## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`esp32-gamma-stim` firmware — ESP32 gamma stimulation actuator (ADR-250 §21 M2 device harness).** The hardware side of `ruview-gamma`: an ESP32 driving an LED + audio flicker at a commanded 36–44 Hz envelope with a hardware emergency stop. Split into a **pure, host-tested safety core** (`main/stim_core.{h,c}` — envelope validation mirroring `SafetyEnvelope::conservative()`, a latched START/STOP/e-stop state machine, exact integer timing math in millihertz so the ±0.1 Hz HIL target is exact, and a line-protocol parser; **15 host tests pass under gcc, no ESP-IDF needed**) and a thin **ESP-IDF binding** (`main/main.c` — GPTimer ISR, LEDC PWM for LED+audio, sync-out GPIO for logic-analyzer capture, e-stop GPIO ISR that kills outputs in microseconds, USB-CDC console). Defense in depth: the device re-enforces the safety envelope independently of the Rust host, so a buggy/compromised host still cannot command an out-of-envelope output. Emits a canonical integer `SESSION {...}` record per run for witness-hash reproduction. Maps 1:1 to the five `hil::verify_hil` targets. Kconfig pin config, 4 MB single-app, radio-off deterministic actuator profile.
- **`ruview-gamma` claim-gate invariant + hardware-in-the-loop contract.** Centralized the claim release rule into a single `acceptance::claim_allowed(entrainment, safety, adherence, repeatability)` (strict AND of all four) used by every path, with a test proving every 3-of-4 subset is denied — no path can weaken the gate. New `hil` module: `verify_hil` grades a captured actuator bench measurement against fixed targets (LED frequency ±0.1 Hz, audio-visual sync < 5 ms, stop-signal→actuator-off < 100 ms, session-hash reproducibility 100%, EEG entrainment lift ≥ 20% over fixed 40 Hz) — the next acceptance milestone for a real LED+speaker (e.g. ESP32) actuator; all failure modes fail closed (missing stop measurement, no replay, any hash mismatch). README gains the benchmark table and the "governed personalization engine that refuses to overpromise" positioning. 9 new tests; crate now 97 + 1 doctest; pinned witness preserved.
- **`ruview-gamma` generalized to an adaptive sensory neuromodulation platform (ADR-250 §23).** 40 Hz is now one prior in one program, not the product. New `program` module: `NeuroProgram` catalog of 7 use cases (Alzheimer's research, post-stroke cognition, sleep optimization, attention/working-memory, mood/arousal, home wellness, drug+device trial infrastructure), each with its own `SafetyEnvelope`, starting prior, `ObjectiveWeights`, physiological-state gating (sleep permits `Asleep` + near-dark brightness cap; attention requires wakefulness), `EvidenceLevel`, and a single non-disease claim. New `acceptance` module makes the acceptance sentence executable: `AcceptanceHarness` grades a program over ≥3 repeats on entrainment gain, safety-stop rate, adherence, and optimal-frequency repeatability, exposing a `ClaimGate` that returns the program's claim **only if all four criteria pass** — the marketing claim is otherwise unreadable (`NO_CLAIM`). Governor wiring: `enroll_program` (per-program envelope/objective; `enroll` stays the bare Alzheimer's-defaults path so the pinned witness `13cb164c…` is preserved), `program()`, `prior()`, `state_eligible()`. 13 new module tests + 2 platform integration tests (per-program envelope enforced end-to-end — a stimulus valid for Alzheimer's is refused by the sleep program; acceptance gates every catalog program's claim); crate now 88 tests + 1 doctest. Bench: full 3-repeat program grading ~425 µs.
- **`ruview-gamma` RuVector self-learning layer (ADR-250 §10 items 3–6).** New `ruvector` module: anonymized `ProfileStore` (one-way SHA-256 hashed tags, never `person_id`; safe-session scores only), deterministic exact kNN (fixed-range normalization, index tie-break), **cohort warm-start** — a new person's optimizer is seeded from the k nearest responders as down-weighted GP pseudo-observations (`BayesianOptimizer::observe_prior`, ≥25× real-observation noise, excluded from the EI incumbent / audit / clinician report), **physiological drift detection** (Welford centroid with stimulus-input fields masked out of the distance; `Drifted` recommends re-calibration), and deterministic k-means response clustering (farthest-point seeding, no RNG). Wired into `RufloGovernor` (`seed_from_cohort`, `export_anonymized_profile`, per-session `drift_status`). The GP gains per-observation noise (real path unchanged — pinned witness `13cb164c…` preserved). 11 new module tests + 2 integration tests (cohort warm-start beats the cold 40 Hz prior for a detuned subject; collapsed physiology flags drift); crate now 75 tests + 1 doctest. Benches: kNN over 500 profiles ~15 µs, full warm-start ~16 µs; no regression on existing paths.
- **`ruview-gamma` crate (ADR-250) — Adaptive Gamma Entrainment.** Governed, deterministic, safety-constrained personalization of 40 Hz-prior light+sound stimulation, treating 40 Hz as the evidence-based *starting prior* and learning each person's safe entrainment response curve. Eleven modules: `stimulus` (params + `SafetyEnvelope` validate/clamp), `safety` (exclusion screen + latched `SafetyMonitor` with hard-stop reasons), `response` (`RuViewState`, optional `EegMeasurement`, 20-field `PersonResponseVector` with sticky adverse flag), `objective` (safe-entrainment score; safety is a hard gate, not a weight), `simulator` (deterministic ChaCha20 `frequency_response_curve`), `optimizer` (Phase-1 calibration sweep + Phase-2 GP/Expected-Improvement + Phase-4 closed-loop control), `bandit` (Phase-3 LinUCB over envelope-safe arms), `session` (reproducible SHA-256 `session_hash`), `ruflo` (consent→exclusion→envelope→run→monitor→score→update→witnessed audit, trial/sham mode, clinician export, claim discipline), `proof` (deterministic bundle witness), `math` (dependency-light numerics). **Safety invariant** (asserted in tests): no recommendation, calibration step, bandit arm, or closed-loop nudge can ever emit a stimulus outside the `SafetyEnvelope`; non-finite inputs clamp to the conservative floor. **Claim discipline**: the only product claim is `PRODUCT_CLAIM` = "personalized entrainment optimization" — never Alzheimer's treatment (ADR-250 §19). Standalone leaf crate (no internal RuView deps), `publish = false` pending safety sign-off. 64 unit/integration tests + 1 doctest pass; deterministic witness pinned (`13cb164c…`); criterion benches (safety-stop tick ~9.3 ns vs the ADR §17 500 ms bound, Bayesian recommend ~105 µs, full 9-session governed sweep ~486 µs). See [ADR-250](docs/adr/ADR-250-adaptive-gamma-entrainment.md).
- **RuView beyond-SOTA research series** (`docs/research/ruview-beyond-sota/`, 6 docs) — research-swarm output defining the beyond-SOTA bar and the path to it: system capability audit (role→crate maturity matrix, gap analysis, risk register), web-verified 2026 SOTA landscape per capability axis (incl. ratified IEEE 802.11bf-2025), 8-pillar target architecture on the ADR-136 contract spine (no rewrite), 6-layer benchmark/validation methodology (all 15 criterion bench targets inventoried; ADR-149 statistical protocol), and a determinism-safe optimization roadmap. Includes session validation evidence: 2,797 workspace tests / 0 failed, Python proof PASS (bit-exact), paired pre/post criterion runs.

### Performance
- **`ruview-gamma` Bayesian optimizer factorized once per recommendation.** `BayesianOptimizer::recommend` evaluated Expected Improvement at every 0.1 Hz grid candidate, and each `predict` rebuilt the full kernel matrix and re-ran Cholesky — ~82 factorizations per recommendation, though `K` and `alpha = K⁻¹y` depend only on the observations, not the query point. Now the GP is fit once (`GpFit`: cached `L` + `alpha`, lower-triangle-only `K` build) and reused across the grid. Bit-identical arithmetic (the pinned deterministic witness `13cb164c…` and all 64 tests are unchanged), pure work elimination. Measured (criterion, paired): `gamma_bayesian_recommend` 105 µs → 19 µs (**−81%**), `gamma_calibration_sweep` (9 recommends) 466 µs → 135 µs (**−71%**).
- **CIR estimator warm-start precompute** — the diagonal Tikhonov preconditioner `diag(Φ^H Φ)+λI` and its CSR matrix were rebuilt every frame although they depend only on Φ and λ (fixed at `CirEstimator::new`); now precomputed at construction (`ruvsense/cir.rs`). Bit-identical floats (summation order unchanged, witness chain unaffected). Measured: `cir_estimate/he40` −3.9% (p<0.01), multiband groups −1.2/−1.4%; smaller configs within container noise.
- **RF tomography solver hoisting** — ISTA gradient buffer no longer allocated inside the 100-iteration loop, and the Frobenius Lipschitz bound moved from per-`reconstruct` to construction (`ruvsense/tomography.rs`). Bit-identical results.

### Added
- **Falsifiable occupancy benchmark (`wifi-densepose-train::occupancy_bench`).** Makes the presence/person-count "beyond SOTA" claim falsifiable in code instead of aspirational (the unfalsifiability gap from the beyond-SOTA system review). Grades predictions vs ground truth and gates a SOTA claim behind one `claim_allowed` invariant requiring all of: `DataProvenance::Measured` (synthetic/mock is scorable but **never claimable** — anti-mock-contamination per the CLAUDE.md Kconfig-bug lesson), a leak-free `EvalSplit` (refuses any split where a subject *or* environment id appears in both train and test — subject leakage / per-environment overfitting), `n_test ≥ min`, presence-F1 **bootstrap-CI lower bound** (deterministic seeded splitmix64) clearing the threshold, and count MAE within threshold. The claim string is unreadable except through the gate (`NO_CLAIM` otherwise) — same discipline as the `ruview-gamma` acceptance gate. What remains is data, not method: a frozen, SHA-pinned, subject/environment-disjoint measured replay set turns the claim into a passing/failing test. 10 tests cover each refusal path.
- **Live trust path: sensing-server now routes real frames through the governed `StreamingEngine`.** Previously the live server ran only the *bare* `MultistaticFuser` (fused amplitudes, no trust control plane), while the privacy/provenance/witness engine (ADR-135..146) ran only on synthetic in-test frames — the gap called out in ADR-136 §8 and the beyond-SOTA system review (the privacy control plane was bypassable). New `engine_bridge` module drives `StreamingEngine::process_cycle` from the server's live `NodeState` map (reusing the existing `NodeState → MultiBandCsiFrame` conversion), lazily wiring each node as a WorldGraph sensor and bounding belief growth via the retention cap. Wired additively into both live ESP32/WiFi fusion sites in `main.rs` (split-borrow off the write guard; does not alter person-count behavior) and stores the latest BLAKE3 witness on `AppState`. Every published belief now carries evidence + model + calibration + privacy decision and a deterministic witness. Adds `wifi-densepose-engine/-worldgraph/-bfld/-geo` deps. 6 new bridge tests (witnessed belief with provenance, determinism, idempotent node registration, retention bound, privacy-mode propagation); sensing-server suite 430+128 green.

### Fixed
- **WorldGraph no longer grows unboundedly under the live loop.** `StreamingEngine::process_cycle` appended one `SemanticState` belief per cycle with no eviction — ~1.7M nodes/day at 20 Hz (identified in `docs/research/ruview-beyond-sota/04-optimization-roadmap.md`). Added `WorldGraph::prune_semantic_states(max)` — deterministic eviction of the oldest beliefs by `(valid_from_unix_ms, id)`, structural nodes (rooms/zones/sensors/anchors/tracks/events) never eligible — and wired it into the engine after each belief append (`StreamingEngine::DEFAULT_SEMANTIC_RETENTION` = 7,200 ≈ 6 min at 20 Hz; tunable via `set_semantic_retention`). The WorldGraph holds *current* beliefs; durable history is the recorder's job, so no audit data is lost. 3 new tests (bounded growth end-to-end, oldest-only eviction, deterministic tie-break).
- **ESP32 edge heart rate no longer stuck at ~45 BPM / dropping wildly — #987.** The on-device HR estimator (`edge_processing.c`, `0xC5110002`) reported ~45 BPM regardless of true heart rate (Apple-Watch ground truth 87 BPM read as ~45) and swung frame-to-frame. Two root causes: (1) a hardcoded `sample_rate = 10.0f` that became wrong after #985's self-ping raised the CSI callback rate to a variable ~13–19 Hz — BPM scales as `assumed/actual × true`, so 87 read ~45 and the reading swung as CSI yield fluctuated; (2) the zero-crossing estimator locked onto a breathing harmonic (a 0.25 Hz breathing fundamental puts its 3rd harmonic at ~0.74 Hz ≈ 44 BPM inside the HR band). Fix: measure the real sample rate from inter-frame timestamps (used for BPM conversion + biquad re-tuning on >15% drift); replace the HR zero-crossing with an autocorrelation estimator that rejects breathing harmonics (driven by a robust autocorr breathing period); median-13 smooth the output. Hardware A/B (fixed vs unmodified control board, both `edge_tier=2`): control pegged 40–49 BPM; fixed reaches the true 88–91 BPM (vs 87 GT) and holds a stable physiological value (spread 59→0 for a steady subject). Known limitation: heavy subject motion still degrades the estimate (motion gating is a follow-up).
- **Person count no longer leaks up to 10 in heuristic mode — addresses #894.** `field_bridge::occupancy_or_fallback` returned the eigenvalue-based `FieldModel::estimate_occupancy` count **unbounded** (its internal ceiling is 10), while the sibling estimators on the same single-link data — the perturbation-energy fallback right below it and `score_to_person_count` — both cap at 3 ("1-3 for single ESP32"). On noisy / under-calibrated CSI the eigenvalue count inflated, producing the "10 persons reported when 1 present" symptom (seen when `--model` fails to load and the server runs on heuristics). Bounded the eigenvalue path to the shared `MAX_SINGLE_LINK_OCCUPANCY` (3) so every estimator on one link agrees; genuine higher counts come from the multistatic fusion path, not a single-link covariance estimate.
- **MQTT multi-node deployments now create one Home-Assistant device per node — closes #898.** After the #872 MQTT wiring landed, the JSON→`VitalsSnapshot` bridge hard-coded a single `node_id` (the MQTT client id) and the publisher used a single `OwnedDiscoveryBuilder`, so every physical node collapsed into one device (`identifiers:["wifi_densepose_wifi-densepose-1"]`), contradicting the "one device per node" docs. The bridge now emits one snapshot per node in the sensing update's `nodes[]` (each with its own `node_id` + RSSI, falling back to a single aggregate snapshot for wifi/simulate sources), and the publisher derives a per-node builder (`OwnedDiscoveryBuilder::for_node`) that publishes discovery + availability lazily on first sight of each `node_id` and routes state to per-node topics — yielding N distinct HA devices with per-node availability/LWT. Unit-tested (distinct nodes → distinct `wifi_densepose_<node>` identifiers); 71 MQTT tests pass.
- **Person count no longer pinned to 1 — addresses #803.** The aggregate occupancy reported by the sensing server was derived from `smoothed_person_score`, an EMA-smoothed *activity* score (amplitude variance / motion / spectral energy). That score saturates near a single occupant — one moving person maxes it out — so it cannot discriminate occupancy *count* and stayed clamped at 1 across S3/C6 and the Python/Docker/Rust servers. Meanwhile the count-aware per-node estimates the ESP32 paths already compute (firmware `n_persons`, and the DynamicMinCut `corr_persons`) were stashed in `NodeState::prev_person_count` and then **discarded** by the aggregator (same dead-wiring class as #872). The aggregator now takes `max(activity_count, node_max)` via a unit-tested `aggregate_person_count` helper, so a node positively estimating 2–3 occupants is surfaced instead of overwritten. The fix can only ever *raise* the count when a node reports more people, so the single-occupant case is provably never inflated (regression-guarded by test). **Second half:** the pure-CSI per-node path itself clamped its own estimate — the DynamicMinCut occupancy (`estimate_persons_from_correlation`, 0–3) was mapped to a score via `corr_persons / 3.0`, putting 2 people at 0.667, *just under* the 0.70 up-threshold of `score_to_person_count`, so the per-node count never climbed past 1 (so `node_max` was also stuck at 1 for CSI-only nodes). Replaced it with a threshold-aligned `corr_persons_to_score` mapping (1→0.40, 2→0.74, 3→0.96) whose steady state round-trips back to the same count through the EMA + hysteresis, while still gating transient noise. A convergence test replays the exact EMA loop to prove min-cut=2 now reports 2 (and documents that the old `/3.0` mapping reported 1). Full multi-person accuracy still depends on the underlying estimator quality; this removes the two server-side clamps that masked it. 586 sensing-server tests pass.
- **MQTT publisher now actually runs (`--mqtt`) — closes #872.** The `--mqtt*` flags were defined only in `cli::Args` (dead code, referenced nowhere) while the binary parses a *separate* `main::Args` with no mqtt fields, and `main.rs` never started the `mqtt::` publisher — so MQTT/Home-Assistant integration was completely unwired (`--mqtt` errored as an unexpected argument, and even with the Docker image's `--features mqtt` build the publisher never ran). Earlier attempts chased a Docker *rebuild*; the real cause was disconnected *code*. Extracted the flags into a shared `cli::MqttArgs` (`#[command(flatten)]` into both structs), spawn the publisher on `--mqtt`, and bridge the JSON sensing broadcast into the typed `VitalsSnapshot` stream with a defensive `serde_json::Value` mapping. Verified end-to-end against `mosquitto`: 20 HA auto-discovery entities + live state (presence/person-count/…). 577 (default) / 580 (`--features mqtt`) tests pass.
- **Mass Casualty triage never reports a survivor with a heartbeat as Deceased (safety) — PR #926.** Both triage paths in `wifi-densepose-mat` — `TriageCalculator::calculate` (`combine_assessments(Absent, None) ⇒ Deceased`) and the detection path `EnsembleClassifier::determine_triage` (`!has_breathing && !has_movement ⇒ Deceased`) — ignored the `heartbeat` field. A survivor with a detectable **pulse** but no sensed breathing/movement (respiratory arrest — the most time-critical *savable* state, Immediate/Red) was therefore reported **Deceased (Black)** and deprioritized for rescue. The domain path was in fact only reachable *because* a heartbeat made `has_vitals()` true, so every "Deceased" was a live person. Both paths now escalate to **Immediate** when a heartbeat is present; total absence of breathing, movement *and* heartbeat is unchanged (domain → `Unknown`, ensemble → `Deceased`). 2 safety regression tests; full MAT suite (177) green.
- **Per-node Home-Assistant devices now report each node's *own* presence/motion — PR #918.** After the one-device-per-node fan-out landed, the MQTT bridge still applied the *room-level aggregate* `classification` to every node, so in a multi-node deployment a node watching an empty corner inherited another node's "present" (and `motion_level: "absent"` was mis-mapped to full motion). Each node in the broadcast `nodes[]` already carries its own `classification`; the bridge now reads it per node (extracted into a testable `vitals_snapshots_from_sensing_json`), keeping vitals + person count room-level. 4 unit tests.
- **`--model` gives an actionable diagnostic instead of a cryptic magic error — PR #919 (refs #894).** Passing a HuggingFace `ruvnet/wifi-densepose-pretrained` file (`model.safetensors` / `model-q4.bin` / `model.rvf.jsonl`) to `--model` produced `invalid magic at offset 0: … got 0x77455735`, then a silent fall back to heuristics. The load-failure path now detects the format (safetensors / quantized blob / JSONL manifest) and explains that those files are a different format **and** encoder architecture than the RVF binary container the progressive loader expects, pointing to #894. Pure `diagnose_model_load_error` + 4 tests.
- **`--export-rvf` no longer silently produces a placeholder model — PR #920.** The `--export-rvf` handler ran *before* `--train`/`--pretrain` and unconditionally wrote placeholder sine-wave weights, so the documented `--train … --export-rvf <path>` workflow short-circuited to a fake model and never trained (while printing "exported successfully"). It now emits the placeholder **container-format demo** only standalone (with a clear warning), and falls through to real training when `--train`/`--pretrain` is set; docs point to `--save-rvf` for the real model. 3 guard tests.

### Added
- **WiFi-CSI pose: efficiency frontier + per-room calibration service** (ADR-150 §3.2–3.6). Two beyond-SOTA results on the MM-Fi benchmark, plus the deployment mechanism that resolves real-world generalization:
  - **Efficiency frontier** — a **75 K-param model beats published SOTA** (74.3% vs MultiFormer 72.25% torso-PCK@20); every config from `micro` up is Pareto-dominant (smaller *and* more accurate than prior work). Shipped a deployable **int4 edge model (~20 KB, verified 74.08%, 0.135 ms single-thread CPU)** — published at [`ruvnet/wifi-densepose-mmfi-pose/edge`](https://huggingface.co/ruvnet/wifi-densepose-mmfi-pose). See [`docs/benchmarks/wifi-pose-efficiency-frontier.md`](docs/benchmarks/wifi-pose-efficiency-frontier.md).
  - **Generalization solved by few-shot calibration** — zero-shot cross-subject (~64%) and cross-environment (~10%) are *not* closeable by algorithms (CORAL, DANN, instance-norm, contrastive foundation-pretraining all tested, all failed) or by more training subjects (saturates ~64%). But **~100–200 labeled in-room samples recover SOTA-level pose**: cross-subject 64→76%, **cross-environment 10→73% (60% from just 5 samples)** — deployable as a **~11 KB per-room LoRA adapter** on a frozen shared base. Full empirical chain in ADR-150 §3.2–3.6.
  - **Calibration service (complete, both model paths, cross-language verified)** — `aether-arena/calibration/`: `calibrate.py` (transformer model, `.npz` adapter) + `infer.py` (verified 3.09%→74.29% on an unseen MM-Fi room), **and `cog_calibrate.py`** which fits a `fc1.a/fc1.b/fc2.a/fc2.b` **safetensors** adapter for the deployed cog conv+MLP model (`pose_v1.safetensors`). Consumed by the Rust product engine: `InferenceEngine::with_adapter()` + `cog-pose-estimation run --config <cfg> --adapter <room.safetensors>`. Self-contained regression tests for both Python producers (`test_calibration.py`, `test_cog_calibration.py`) **plus a cross-language Rust integration test** that loads a real `cog_calibrate.py`-generated adapter fixture and asserts it activates + changes engine output. All green.
- **Windows workspace build + test now green** (cross-platform fixes). `wifi-densepose-worldmodel` imported `tokio::net::UnixStream` unconditionally, so `cargo build/test --workspace` failed to compile on Windows (E0432) — now the OccWorld Unix-socket bridge is `#[cfg(unix)]`-gated with a clear non-unix fallback. And `wifi-densepose-bfld`'s `readme_quickstart_uses_canonical_public_api` test checked a multi-line `pipeline\n    .process` needle that never matched on a CRLF checkout — now normalizes line endings. Result: **2,682 workspace tests pass / 0 fail on Windows** (the pre-merge gate was previously unrunnable there).
- **`ruview-swarm` crate (ADR-148)** — drone swarm control system with hierarchical-mesh topology, Raft consensus, MAPPO multi-agent reinforcement learning, and CSI sensing integration. 14 modules: topology (Raft/Gossip/Mesh), formation control (virtual-structure/leader-follower/Reynolds flocking), RRT-APF path planning, auction+FNN task allocation, MARL actor + PPO training loop, security (MAVLink v2 HMAC-SHA256 signing, UWB anti-spoofing, geofencing, Remote ID, FHSS anti-jamming), 10-state fail-safe machine, and SwarmOrchestrator. ITAR-gated coordination features (USML Category VIII(h)(12)) behind `itar-unrestricted` feature.
- **Ruflo integration for `ruview-swarm`** — feature-gated (`ruflo`) AI-agent capability layer connecting to the claude-flow daemon: AgentDB mission memory (`memory_store`/`memory_search`), HNSW pattern learning (`agentdb_pattern-store`/`-search`), AIDefence MAVLink message scanning, and SONA intelligence trajectory hooks. `RufloBackend` trait with `HttpRufloBackend` (JSON-RPC 2.0) and `MockRufloBackend` implementations.

### Performance
- `ruview-swarm` benchmarks (criterion, release): MARL actor inference 3.3 µs, RRT-APF planning 0.043 ms, multi-view CSI fusion 58.5 ns, 3-view localization 1.732 m (beats Wi2SAR 5 m SOTA baseline), 4-drone SAR coverage 223 s for 400×400 m (under 240 s target).

### Added
- **ADR-147 — OccWorld world model integration** (`wifi-densepose-worldmodel` v0.3.0 published to crates.io). 15-frame trajectory prediction at 209 ms / 3.37 GB VRAM on RTX 5080. Phase 3 domain adapter `scripts/ruview_occ_dataset.py` (`RuViewOccDataset`) converts WorldGraph snapshots to OccWorld tensors with indoor class remapping + zero ego-poses (validated). Phase 5 retraining pipeline `scripts/occworld_retrain.py` — VQVAE + transformer fine-tuning on RuView occupancy snapshots. See [ADR-147](docs/adr/ADR-147-nvidia-cosmos-world-foundation-model-integration.md) · [benchmark proof](docs/adr/ADR-147-benchmark-proof.md).

### Added
- **ADR-125 (APPLE-FABRIC) — RuView ↔ Apple Home native HAP bridge proposal + reference impl** (issue #796). New ADR-125 lays out a three-phase plan to expose RuView as a discoverable HomeKit accessory on the LAN so a HomePod (as Home Hub) sees presence / vitals / BFLD-derived events natively — zero Home-Assistant intermediary. Two architectural decisions resolved in the ADR per design review: (1) **one HAP bridge with N child accessories** (single pairing, matches Hue/Eve pattern), and (2) **identity-risk mapping is semantic, not probabilistic** — `identity_risk_score` and Soul-Signature match probability never cross the HAP boundary; instead three thresholded events are exposed (`Unknown Presence`, `Unexpected Occupancy`, `Unrecognized Activity Pattern`) so RuView reads as calm-tech ambient awareness, not surveillance UX. ADR-125 §2.1.a reference impl ships now: `scripts/hap-test-sensor.py` (HAP-1.1 bridge advertised over mDNS, paired with operator's iPhone) + `scripts/c6-presence-watcher.py` (parses ESP32 `RV_FEATURE_STATE_MAGIC = 0xC5110006` UDP packets with IEEE CRC32 validation, hysteresis, and a Python port of `wifi-densepose-bfld::PrivacyClass` that enforces ADR-125 §2.1.d invariant I1 at the HomeKit edge — only `Anonymous` (2) and `Restricted` (3) frames may cross; `Raw`/`Derived` are refused with exit code 2 and the cited ADR clause). Validated end-to-end on real hardware (no mocks): ESP32-C6 on `ruv.net` → UDP/5005 → mac-mini watcher → BFLD gate → HAP bridge → iPhone Home app shows `Unknown Presence` live characteristic flip. **Empirical**: 50-51 valid CRC-passing feature_state packets per 10 s window from the live C6; zero CRC errors. P2 (Rust-native HAP via the `hap` crate, replaces the Python sidecar) and P3 (Matter Controller once `matter-rs` stabilizes) follow.

### Security
- **ESP32 OTA upload now fails closed when no PSK is provisioned** (#596 audit finding — critical, **breaking change for unprovisioned nodes**). `ota_check_auth()` previously returned `true` when `s_ota_psk[0] == '\0'`, so a freshly-flashed node would accept attacker-controlled firmware over plain HTTP on port 8032 from any host on the WiFi. No Secure Boot V2, no signed-image verification — a single LAN call could brick or backdoor a node. The fix rejects every OTA upload until a PSK is written to NVS (the OTA HTTP server still starts so operators can run `provision.py --ota-psk <hex>` over USB-CDC without reflashing). **Operators affected**: any deployment that relied on the unauthenticated OTA endpoint working out of the box now needs to provision a PSK before subsequent OTA pushes will succeed. Boot-time `ESP_LOGW` makes the new posture visible.
- **Bearer-token auth accepts the scheme case-insensitively (RFC 6750) — PR #929.** `require_bearer` parsed the `Authorization` header with a case-sensitive `strip_prefix("Bearer ")`, so a *correct* `RUVIEW_API_TOKEN` sent as `Authorization: bearer <token>` (or `BEARER`, or with extra whitespace) was rejected with a confusing 401 — needless friction when enabling auth. The scheme is now matched with `eq_ignore_ascii_case` (per RFC 6750 §2.1 / RFC 7235 §2.1); the token compare is unchanged — still exact and constant-time (`ct_eq`) — so a wrong token or a non-Bearer scheme (`Basic …`) still returns 401. Audited the surrounding code while here: `ct_eq` correctly rejects length mismatch (no prefix-auth bypass) and the middleware fails closed. New `accepts_case_insensitive_bearer_scheme` test.
- **Path-traversal vulnerabilities patched in five sensing-server endpoints** (closes #615 — critical). New `wifi_densepose_sensing_server::path_safety::safe_id()` enforces `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` only (no leading `.`, max 64 chars) before any user-controlled identifier reaches a `format!()` building a filesystem path. Applied at:
  - `POST /api/v1/recording/start` (`recording.rs` — `session_name`)
  - `GET /api/v1/recording/download/:id` (`recording.rs` — `id`)
  - `DELETE /api/v1/recording/delete/:id` (`recording.rs` — `id`)
  - `POST /api/v1/models/load` (`model_manager.rs` — `model_id`)
  - `training_api.rs` `load_recording_frames` (`dataset_id`s)

  Pre-fix, unauthenticated callers could read `../../etc/passwd`-style paths, write arbitrary JSONL files, load attacker-controlled `.rvf` model files, or delete arbitrary files the server process could touch. 9 unit tests in `path_safety::tests` exercise the rejection envelope (empty, too-long, path separators, parent-dir traversal, null byte, whitespace/specials, non-ASCII).

### Fixed
- **WebSocket `/ws/sensing` now reports `esp32:offline` when ESP32 hardware goes stale** (closes #618). `broadcast_tick_task` was re-emitting the cached `latest_update` with a frozen `source: "esp32"` field forever after the hardware lost power or network. The REST `/health` endpoint already called `effective_source()` (which returns `"esp32:offline"` after `ESP32_OFFLINE_TIMEOUT` = 5 s with no UDP frames), but the WS broadcast path was the one consumer that didn't. Result: the UI's "LIVE — ESP32 HARDWARE Connected" banner stayed green long after the hardware went away, and `vital_signs`/`features`/`classification` re-broadcasted the last-seen values indefinitely. Fix: clone the cached `latest_update` per tick, overwrite `source` with `s.effective_source()`, then serialize and broadcast. UI can now switch to an offline state on the same 5-second budget the REST surface uses.
- **Proof replay (`archive/v1/data/proof/verify.py`) is now cross-platform deterministic** (closes #560). Three changes together: (1) `features_to_bytes()` now `np.round(.., HASH_QUANTIZATION_DECIMALS=6)`s each feature array before packing as little-endian f64, collapsing ULP-level drift from scipy.fft pocketfft SIMD reordering; (2) the `Verify Pipeline Determinism` workflow pins `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`, `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`, `MKL_NUM_THREADS=1`, `VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=1`, `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1` — multi-threaded BLAS reductions were a deeper source of non-determinism than SIMD reordering, and 6-decimal quantization alone wasn't enough across Azure VM microarchitectures; (3) `expected_features.sha256` regenerated under the new conditions. CI now passes the determinism check (same hash across consecutive runs on canonical Linux x86_64 CI runner: `667eb054c44ac510342665bf9c93d608868a8ead948ae8774b2796ebce6f8fe7`). `scripts/probe-fft-platform.py` updated to mirror `HASH_QUANTIZATION_DECIMALS=6` for cross-machine spot-checks.
- **`archive/v1/src/services/pose_service.py:223` calls the right method on `PhaseSanitizer`** (closes #612). The call was `self.phase_sanitizer.sanitize(phase_data)`, but `PhaseSanitizer`'s full-pipeline entry point is named `sanitize_phase()` (`unwrap_phase` + `remove_outliers` + `smooth_phase` chained, see `archive/v1/src/core/phase_sanitizer.py:266`). The shorter `sanitize` name doesn't exist on the class, so any path that reached this branch raised `AttributeError` and crashed the pose service mid-frame.
- **`adaptive_classifier.rs:94` no longer panics on NaN feature values** (closes #611).
  `sorted.sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())` returned `None` and panicked
  whenever a single `NaN` reached the classifier from real ESP32 hardware (silent
  DSP div-by-zero, empty buffer). One bad frame killed the entire sensing-server
  process. Swapped for `unwrap_or(Ordering::Equal)`, matching the pattern the
  same file already used at lines 149-150 and 155. Per-frame hot path; this was
  a real production crash vector.
- **Completed the #611 NaN-panic audit across the sensing-server crate** (follow-up
  to #613). The original audit grepped for the literal `partial_cmp(b).unwrap()`
  and missed seven additional production sites that use comparator variants
  (`partial_cmp(b.1).unwrap()`, `partial_cmp(&variances[b]).unwrap()`). All share
  the same crash class — a single `NaN` in CSI-derived state panics the whole
  sensing-server. Fixed:
  - `adaptive_classifier.rs:205` — `AdaptiveModel::classify()` argmax over softmax
    probs. **Same per-frame hot path as #611**; NaN flows through normalise →
    logits → softmax and still reaches this site even after the #613 IQR fix.
  - `adaptive_classifier.rs:480, 500` — training-loop argmax in `train()`
    (training/per-class accuracy reporting).
  - `main.rs:2446, 2449` and `csi.rs:602, 605` — variance-based source/sink
    selection in `count_persons_mincut`. The outer `unwrap_or((0, &0))` only
    catches an empty iterator; it cannot rescue a comparator panic.

  Remaining `partial_cmp(...).unwrap()` sites in the workspace are all inside
  `#[cfg(test)]` / `#[test]` blocks (`spectrogram.rs:269`, `depth.rs:234`,
  `connectivity.rs:477`, `vital_signs.rs:737`) where inputs are controlled.
- **`ui/utils/pose-renderer.js` no longer divides by zero** when two render frames land in the same `performance.now()` tick (issue #519 Bug 2). `deltaTime` is now `Math.max(currentTime - lastFrameTime, 1)` before the `1000 / deltaTime` division, capping displayed FPS at 1000 — far above any real render rate, but finite so the EMA `averageFps = averageFps * 0.9 + fps * 0.1` no longer poisons itself to `Infinity` on a single zero-dt tick.

### Removed
- **Stub crates `wifi-densepose-api`, `wifi-densepose-db`, `wifi-densepose-config`** (closes #578).
  Each was a single-line doc-comment placeholder with an empty `[dependencies]`
  section and zero references from any source file or `Cargo.toml`. The names
  were reserved early for an envisioned REST/database/config split that never
  materialised; the functionality they would provide is covered today by
  `wifi-densepose-sensing-server` (Axum REST/WS), per-crate config + CLI args,
  and the project's real-time-only (no-persistent-state) posture. Removing them
  from the workspace prevents `cargo` from listing dead crates and shipping
  empty published artifacts. If any of these names is needed in the future,
  they can be reintroduced with a real implementation.

### Added
- **BFLD — Beamforming Feedback Layer for Detection (ADR-118 umbrella + ADR-119 frame format + ADR-120 privacy class + ADR-121 identity risk scoring + ADR-122 RuView HA/Matter exposure + ADR-123 capture path, [#787](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/787)).** New crate `wifi-densepose-bfld` (`v2/crates/wifi-densepose-bfld/`) — the privacy-gated WiFi sensing layer that detects when RF data crosses from "ambient sensing" into "identity record" and **structurally prevents** identity-correlated data from leaving the node. Three invariants enforced by the type system (not policy): **I1** raw BFI never exits the node (`Sink` marker-trait hierarchy + `PrivacyClass::Raw.allows_network() == false`), **I2** identity embedding is in-RAM-only (`IdentityEmbedding` has no `Serialize`/`Clone`/`Copy` + `Drop` zeroizes), **I3** cross-site identity correlation is cryptographically impossible (per-site BLAKE3-keyed `SignatureHasher` with daily epoch rotation; mean cross-site Hamming distance ≥120 bits across 100 trials). Ships the complete operator surface: `BfldPipeline` + `BfldPipelineHandle` (worker-thread variant + `spawn_with_oracle` for Soul Signature deployments), `BfldEvent` with JSON publishing (`"blake3:<hex>"` `rf_signature_hash` format per spec), 4 `privacy_class` levels (Raw/Derived/Anonymous/Restricted) with `PrivacyGate::demote` monotonic transformer + irreversible `apply_privacy_gating`, `CoherenceGate` with ±0.05 hysteresis + 5-second debounce + clock-skew resilience (saturating_sub), `SoulMatchOracle` Recalibrate-exemption trait for enrolled-person deployments. **MQTT/HA surface**: `mqtt_topics::render_events` + `publish_event` (class-gated topic routing — Raw/Derived publish 0 topics, Anonymous publishes 6, Restricted publishes 5 with `identity_risk` stripped), `ha_discovery::render_discovery_payloads` + `publish_discovery` (HA-DISCO config payloads with `availability_topic` integration), `availability` module (`online`/`offline` + LWT-aware `with_lwt` helper for `rumqttc::MqttOptions`), `RumqttPublisher` behind a `mqtt` feature gate with `connect_with_lwt` for broker-side auto-offline. **3 operator HA Blueprints** under `v2/crates/cog-ha-matter/blueprints/bfld/` (presence-driven-lighting, motion-aware-HVAC, identity-risk-anomaly-notification with rolling 7-day z-score). **Two runnable examples** (`bfld_minimal` for in-process consumers, `bfld_handle` for the production worker-thread + bootstrap-then-spawn pattern). **GitHub Actions CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/bfld-mqtt-integration.yml`) spins up `eclipse-mosquitto:2` as a service container so the env-gated `mosquitto_integration` and `rumqttc_lwt` tests run end-to-end in CI. **Performance**: `BfldFrame::to_bytes()` measured at **320,255 frames/sec** debug (6.4× ADR-119 AC7 release target of 50k), header-only at 1,654,517 frames/sec, presence-detection latency p95 = **0.9µs** (~1,000,000× under ADR-119 AC2's 1s target), 9.96 Hz motion-publish rate through `BfldPipelineHandle` (10× ADR-122 AC3 floor). **Coverage**: 327 tests at default features, 101 no_std-compatible, 220+ with `--features mqtt`. CRC-32/ISO-HDLC polynomial pinned against `"123456789" → 0xCBF43926`, public-API surface snapshot pinned across all `pub use` re-exports, `BfldError` Display contract pinned for log-grep monitoring rules, reserved-flag-bits forward-compat round-trip property, `apply_privacy_gating` irreversibility (5-cycle round-trip stress proves stripped fields never resurrect). Companion research dossier in `docs/research/BFLD/` (11 files, 13,544 words). 49-iter implementation chain from scaffold (`feat/adr-118/p1`, `c965e3e6c`) through current head with per-iter progress comments on issue [#787](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/787). Try it: `cargo run -p wifi-densepose-bfld --example bfld_handle`.
- **SENSE-BRIDGE — rvagent MCP server + ruvector npm + ruflo integration (ADR-124, [#787](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/787)).** New npm package `@ruvnet/rvagent` (`tools/ruview-mcp/`) — a dual-transport [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that bridges the RuView WiFi-DensePose sensing stack to AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, ruflo swarms). **6 of 20 ADR-124 §4.1 tools wired** in this initial release: `ruview.presence.now` (occupancy), `ruview.vitals.get_breathing` / `get_heart_rate` / `get_all` (biometric vitals via `EdgeVitalsMessage` surface, ADR-124 §6 Python ws.py:74-88 parity), `ruview.bfld.last_scan` (latest BFLD event — `identity_risk_score`, `privacy_class`, `n_frames`, `timestamp_ms`), `ruview.bfld.subscribe` (MQTT wildcard subscription with synthetic UUID envelope fallback). **Dual-transport architecture (ADR-124 §3)**: stdio (`npx @ruvnet/rvagent stdio` — recommended for Claude Code / Cursor local flow) + Streamable HTTP (`POST /mcp` bound to `127.0.0.1:3001` by default — for remote ruflo swarms across the Tailscale fleet). **Security model (ADR-124 §6)**: Origin header validation (cross-origin POST → 403), bearer-token auth slot (`RVAGENT_HTTP_TOKEN` → 401), bind default `127.0.0.1` per MCP spec requirement. **Uniform schema validation gate (ADR-124 §3)**: every `CallTool` request runs `zod.safeParse` via `TOOL_INPUT_SCHEMAS` before dispatch; failures throw `McpError(InvalidParams)`. **Full Zod schema barrel (ADR-124 §4.1 + §4.1a)**: `src/schemas/tools.ts` defines all 20 tool input schemas including the 5 RUVIEW-POLICY governance tools (can_access_vitals, can_query_presence, can_subscribe, redact_identity_fields, audit_log). **Python surface parity**: `EdgeVitalsMessage` TypeScript interface mirrors Python ws.py:74-88; ADR-124 §6 parity table drives the field names. **93 tests across 7 suites** (manifest, schemas, validate, tools, http-transport, bfld-tools, vitals-tools) — all green. Try it: `npx @ruvnet/rvagent stdio` (with `RUVIEW_SENSING_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000`).
- **Home Assistant + Matter integration (ADR-115).** New `--mqtt` and `--matter` flags on `wifi-densepose-sensing-server` expose the full sensing capability set to any Home Assistant install via MQTT auto-discovery (HA-DISCO) and to any Matter controller (Apple Home / Google Home / Alexa / SmartThings) via a built-in Matter Bridge scaffolding (HA-FABRIC, SDK wiring v0.7.1). Includes 21 entity kinds per node — 11 raw signals + 10 inferred semantic primitives (HA-MIND: someone-sleeping, possible-distress, room-active, elderly-inactivity-anomaly, meeting, bathroom, fall-risk, bed-exit, no-movement, multi-room-transition). The semantic primitives run server-side so `--privacy-mode` strips HR/BR/pose values from the wire while still publishing the inferred *states* — the architectural win for healthcare and AAL deployments. Ships **8 starter HA Blueprints** under `examples/ha-blueprints/`, **3 drop-in Lovelace dashboards** under `examples/lovelace/` (including a privacy-mode-compatible healthcare care view), mTLS support, 32 KB payload-size cap, MQTT-wildcard topic-injection rejection, `RUVIEW_MQTT_STRICT_TLS=1` v0.8.0 upgrade path. **420 lib tests** cover the implementation including **~2,560 fuzzed assertions per CI run** (10 proptest cases across wire-boundary security + semantic-bus invariants). Plus mosquitto-backed integration tests in `.github/workflows/mqtt-integration.yml`, criterion benchmarks beating every ADR target by 1.6×–208×, and an ESP32-S3 hardware validation harness (`scripts/validate-esp32-mqtt.sh`) that asserts the full pipeline end-to-end with a witness bundle generator (`scripts/witness-adr-115.sh`) that self-verifies. See [`docs/releases/v0.7.0-mqtt-matter.md`](docs/releases/v0.7.0-mqtt-matter.md), [`docs/integrations/home-assistant.md`](docs/integrations/home-assistant.md), [`docs/integrations/semantic-primitives-metrics.md`](docs/integrations/semantic-primitives-metrics.md), [`docs/integrations/benchmarks.md`](docs/integrations/benchmarks.md), [`docs/adr/ADR-115-home-assistant-integration.md`](docs/adr/ADR-115-home-assistant-integration.md), tracking issue [#776](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/776), PR [#778](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/pull/778). Matter SDK wiring (P8b) and CSA-certification path (P10) deferred to v0.7.1+ per ADR §9.10. Try it: `cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server --features mqtt --example mqtt_publisher -- --mqtt --mqtt-host 127.0.0.1`.
- **ESP32-C6 firmware target with Wi-Fi 6 / 802.15.4 / TWT / LP-core support ([ADR-110](docs/adr/ADR-110-esp32-c6-firmware-extension.md), #762).** `firmware/esp32-csi-node` now builds for **both** `esp32s3` (existing production node) and `esp32c6` (new research/seed-node target) from the same source tree — pick via `idf.py set-target esp32c6` and ESP-IDF auto-applies the new `sdkconfig.defaults.esp32c6` overlay. Every C6 module is `#ifdef CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32C6` gated, so the S3 build is byte-identical to today (no regression).
  - **Wi-Fi 6 HE-LTF subcarrier tagging** — `csi_collector.c` now reads `rx_ctrl.cur_bb_format` and writes the PPDU type (0=HT/legacy, 1=HE-SU, 2=HE-MU, 3=HE-TB) into ADR-018 frame byte 18, plus bandwidth flags (20/40 MHz, STBC, 802.15.4-sync-valid) into byte 19. Bytes 18-19 were previously reserved-zero, so old aggregators read them as before — fully backwards compatible. Magic stays `0xC5110001`. Default on via `CONFIG_CSI_FRAME_HE_TAGGING`. First firmware in the open ESP32 ecosystem to tag CSI frames with 11ax PPDU metadata.
  - **802.15.4 mesh time-sync** — new `c6_timesync.{h,c}` (262 lines) provides cross-node clock alignment over the C6's separate 802.15.4 radio, freeing WiFi airtime from coordination traffic (directly addresses the ADR-029/030 multistatic synchronization gap). Protocol: lowest EUI-64 wins election, leader broadcasts `TS_BEACON` (`magic=0x54534D45`, leader epoch µs) every 100 ms on channel 15, followers compute `offset = leader_us - local_us` and apply lazily — every CSI frame is stamped with `c6_timesync_get_epoch_us()`. Target alignment ±100 µs. Default on via `CONFIG_C6_TIMESYNC_ENABLE`. Verified initializing at boot on COM6 (`c6_ts: init done: channel=15 EUI=206ef1fffefffe17 leader=yes(candidate)` at +413 ms).
  - **TWT (Target Wake Time)** — new `c6_twt.{h,c}` (223 lines) wraps `esp_wifi_sta_itwt_setup` from `esp_wifi_he.h` to negotiate an individual TWT agreement with the AP after STA connect. Replaces today's opportunistic CSI capture with a scheduler-bounded one (default wake interval 10 ms = 100 fps cadence). Graceful NACK fallback: when the AP doesn't support 11ax iTWT, the helper logs and returns OK so the device keeps doing opportunistic CSI just like the S3. Teardown on `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED` keeps the AP's TWT scheduler clean. Gated on `SOC_WIFI_HE_SUPPORT` (auto-set on C6/C5 chips).
  - **LP-core wake-on-motion hibernation** — new `c6_lp_core.{h,c}` (134 lines) arms the C6 LP RISC-V coprocessor as an always-on motion gate; HP core stays in deep sleep until a configurable GPIO wakes it (ext1 deep-sleep wake source in this initial cut, real LP-core program in follow-up). Targets ≤5 µA hibernation current for battery-powered Cognitum Seed nodes (vs the S3's ~10 µA ULP-FSM floor). Opt-in via `CONFIG_C6_LP_CORE_ENABLE` (default off — only enabled on nodes flashed for battery-powered seed duty).
  - **Build matrix**: S3 stays `partitions_display.csv` (8 MB + display + WASM), C6 uses `partitions_4mb.csv` (4 MB single OTA, no display, no WASM3, no LCD). C6 final binary 1003 KB (46% partition slack), 9 % smaller than S3 production. Free heap 310 KiB at boot, app_main reached in 343 ms, 802.15.4 stack up in another 70 ms.
  - **Why this matters**: opens three research surfaces nobody has published yet — Wi-Fi-6 CSI human pose, multistatic CSI clock alignment over a side-channel radio, and TWT-bounded deterministic CSI cadence. The S3 production fleet keeps shipping the existing capabilities; the C6 is the research / battery-seed expansion target.
  - **Docs**: ADR-110 (186 lines, Status=Accepted), tracking issue [ruvnet/RuView#762](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/762) with per-phase progress comments, README hardware table + Quick-Start Option 2b, `docs/user-guide.md` full ESP32-C6 section (build, flash, provision, multi-room time-sync, battery seed mode), full empirical record in [`docs/WITNESS-LOG-110.md`](docs/WITNESS-LOG-110.md) with verified / claimed / bugs-fixed / bugs-found sections.
  - **Wave 2 follow-up (D1 workaround)**: 5 systematic experiments on 3 live C6 boards confirmed the IDF v5.4 802.15.4 RX path is unfixable from user code (TX works 100 %, RX delivers 0 frames; coex/channel/OpenThread/manual-rearm all ruled out). Pivoted to ESP-NOW for the cross-node sync transport — `main/c6_sync_espnow.{h,c}` is the same TS_BEACON protocol over WiFi peer-to-peer, same `get_epoch_us / is_valid / is_leader` API surface. **120 s single-board soak: 1151 transmits, 0 failures (0.00 %), 9.6 tx/s sustained, no crash or reset.** The 802.15.4 path stays in source as documented-broken (D1) for when the IDF driver gets fixed.
  - **Host-side dual-pipeline decoder for ADR-018 byte 18-19** (ADR-110 protocol closure):
    - **Rust** (`v2/crates/wifi-densepose-hardware`): new `PpduType` enum (HtLegacy/HeSu/HeMu/HeTb/Unknown) and `Adr018Flags` struct (bw40/stbc/ldpc/ieee802154_sync_valid) on `CsiMetadata`. 6 new deterministic unit tests; **122/122 hardware-crate tests pass**.
    - **Python** (`archive/v1/src/hardware/csi_extractor.py`): `HEADER_FMT` extended from `<IBBHIIBB2x` to `<IBBHIIBBBB`; new metadata fields (`ppdu_type`, `he_capable`, `bw40`, `stbc`, `ldpc`, `ieee802154_sync_valid`). 5 new `TestAdr110ByteEncoding` cases; **11/11 parser tests pass**.
    - Both decoders match the firmware encoder bit-for-bit. Pre-ADR-110 firmware sends zeros that round-trip as `HtLegacy` + default flags — fully backwards compatible.
  - **Security fix** (`scripts/redact-secrets.py` + `generate-witness-bundle.sh`): the Python proof step was echoing `.env` contents into the bundled `verification-output.log` via Pydantic validation errors. Bundle nuked before push; added a `stdin -> stdout` redaction filter covering common token prefixes, long opaque strings, and long hex runs. Verified zero leaks on rebuild.
  - **Wave 3 — firmware v0.6.7 (LP-core full + soft-AP HE)**: two software-only unblocks for the hardware-blocked items in WITNESS-LOG-110 §B. (1) **Real LP-core motion-gate program** (`firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/lp_core/main.c` + integration in `c6_lp_core.c`). When `CONFIG_C6_LP_CORE_ENABLE=y`, the LP RISC-V coprocessor now runs a real polling program (configurable cadence via `CONFIG_C6_LP_POLL_PERIOD_US`, default 10 ms) that debounces N consecutive GPIO samples (`CONFIG_C6_LP_DEBOUNCE_SAMPLES`, default 3) and wakes the HP core via `ulp_lp_core_wakeup_main_processor()`. HP entry uses `esp_sleep_enable_ulp_wakeup` + `ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_ULP`. Exposes `c6_lp_core_motion_count()` and `c6_lp_core_poll_count()` getters for the witness harness. **Replaces** the v0.6.6 `esp_deep_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup` ext1 fallback (which floored at ~10 µA, the same as the S3 ULP-FSM). The fallback path stays as the `else` branch so builds without `CONFIG_C6_LP_CORE_ENABLE` keep working unchanged — zero regression for v0.6.6-era fleets. Targets the C6 datasheet ≤5 µA average for battery seed nodes; pending INA/Joulescope measurement to confirm (`WITNESS-LOG-110 §B4`). (2) **Wi-Fi 6 soft-AP with TWT Responder=1** (`c6_softap_he.{h,c}` + `main.c` AP+STA mode switch). When `CONFIG_C6_SOFTAP_HE_ENABLE=y`, one C6 board can act as the iTWT-capable AP the bench is otherwise missing — pair with a second C6-STA board to negotiate real iTWT against a known-cooperative AP and measure deterministic CSI cadence (`WITNESS-LOG-110 §B1/B2`). SSID/PSK/channel configurable via Kconfig defaults or NVS (`softap_ssid`/`softap_psk`/`softap_chan` keys in the `ruview` namespace). Default off so existing nodes are unaffected. **Build artifacts**: S3 8 MB binary 1093 KB (47 % slack), C6 4 MB binary 1019 KB (45 % slack). Tag: `v0.6.7-esp32`.
  - **Wave 4 — firmware v0.6.8 (ESP-NOW mesh offset smoother)**: `c6_sync_espnow.c` now maintains an in-firmware exponential-moving-average of the cross-board sync offset (α = 1/8, fixed-point shift, ≈ 8-sample window at the 10 Hz beacon rate). New getter `c6_sync_espnow_get_offset_us_smoothed()`. `c6_sync_espnow_get_epoch_us()` now returns timestamps stamped from the smoothed offset once seeded — every downstream CSI-frame consumer gets bounded-jitter alignment for free, no host-side filter required. **Measured on the bench**: 5-min two-board soak (WITNESS-LOG-110 §A0.10) drops raw offset stdev 411.5 µs → smoothed 104.1 µs (**3.95× suppression** on stdev, 4.70× on peak-to-peak range) while preserving the +30 µs/min crystal-drift trajectory within 2 µs/min. **The ADR-110 §2.4 ≤100 µs multistatic alignment target that v0.6.6 designed is now empirically measured, not just stated.** Cross-board beacon match rate 99.56% over 5 min, 0 TX failures. Binary cost: +32 bytes (one int64, one bool, one getter). Diag log adds `smoothed=…` field. Tag: `v0.6.8-esp32`. **Known wiring gap (deferred)**: `csi_serialize_frame` does not yet stamp frames with `c6_sync_espnow_get_epoch_us()` — the ADR-018 frame format has no timestamp field, and adding one is a breaking change that needs an ADR update. Multistatic CSI fusion will require either an ADR-018 v2 with timestamp, or a separate UDP sync packet keyed off the existing flag bit. Tracked in WITNESS-LOG-110 §A0.11.
  - **Wave 5 — firmware v0.6.9 + v0.7.0 + host wiring (loop iter 8 → iter 26)**: closes the §A0.11 gap and lights up the substrate end-to-end across firmware → host → JSON broadcast. **Firmware**: (a) **v0.6.9-esp32** — `csi_collector.c` emits a 32-byte UDP sync packet (magic `0xC511A110`, distinct from CSI frame magic `0xC5110001`) every `CONFIG_C6_SYNC_EVERY_N_FRAMES` (default 20) CSI frames, carrying `node_id`, `local_us`, mesh-aligned `epoch_us` (from the Wave 4 smoothed offset), and the CSI sequence high-water for host-side pairing. Same UDP socket as CSI; host dispatches by leading magic. Operator-tunable cadence via the new Kconfig knob — N=1 (10 Hz) for tight multistatic, N=200 (~20 s) for low-power seeds. Live-verified on COM9+COM12 (§A0.12): follower reports `local − epoch = 1 163 565 µs`, matches the §A0.10 boot-delta measurement within 285 µs of WiFi MAC TX jitter. (b) **v0.7.0-esp32** — `csi_collector.c:221` ADR-018 byte 19 bit 4 ("cross-node sync valid") now ORs in `c6_sync_espnow_is_valid()` so frames from sync'd ESP-NOW nodes correctly advertise sync (previously only sourced from the broken 802.15.4 path — false-negative bug, §A0.13). Side effect: S3 boards now also set the bit since `c6_sync_espnow` is cross-target. **Host decoders + 25 unit tests**: Python `SyncPacketParser` + `SyncPacket` dataclass with `apply_to_local` / `mesh_aligned_us_for_sequence` / `local_minus_epoch_us` (10 tests in `TestSyncPacketParser`); Rust `wifi_densepose_hardware::SyncPacket` + `SyncPacketFlags` + `SYNC_PACKET_MAGIC` re-exported from the crate root with identical API surface (15 tests in `sync_packet::tests`). **Cross-language conformance gate** (loop iter 21): the same 32-byte canonical hex `10a111c509010600f26db70100000000c5aca501000000001400000000000000` is pinned in both test suites; if either decoder drifts from the wire, exactly one named test fires and points at the moved side. **Sensing-server wiring**: `udp_receiver_task` magic-dispatches `0xC511A110` and stores per-node `latest_sync: Option<SyncPacket>` + `latest_sync_at: Option<Instant>` on `NodeState`. New helpers: `NodeState::mesh_aligned_us(local_us)`, `NodeState::mesh_aligned_us_for_csi_frame(sequence)` (uses the per-node measured fps EMA with 5-sample warmup + 9 s staleness gate), `NodeState::observe_csi_frame_arrival(now)` (feeds `update_csi_fps_ema` α=1/8, called once per accepted CSI frame). 4 fps-EMA tests + 3 NodeSyncSnapshot serialization tests on the binary target. **Public JSON API**: `sensing_update` broadcasts now carry an optional `sync` object per node — `{offset_us, is_leader, is_valid, smoothed, sequence, csi_fps_ema, csi_fps_samples}` — `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` so non-mesh paths (multi-BSSID scan / synthetic-RSSI fallback / simulation) omit the key entirely. Existing pre-v0.7.0 UI clients ignore it cleanly. Documented in `docs/user-guide.md` "Per-node mesh sync (ADR-110)" section with field table, UI rendering rules, and the timestamp-recovery recipe. **Branch-coordination**: `docs/ADR-110-BRANCH-STATE.md` maps which files each of `adr-110-esp32c6` vs `feat/adr-115-ha-mqtt-matter` touches (regions are disjoint, merges should be clean line-merges). **Verification baselines**: full v2 cargo workspace at **1437 tests passing** (no regression across 17 crate batches), full `wifi-densepose-hardware` crate at **137 tests**. ADR-110 §B substrate is now end-to-end visible to UI clients and ready for ADR-029/030 multistatic CSI fusion consumption.
- **Real-time CSI introspection / low-latency tap on `wifi-densepose-sensing-server` (ADR-099).**
  New `wifi_densepose_sensing_server::introspection` module wires
  [midstream](https://github.com/ruvnet/midstream)'s `temporal-attractor` (Lyapunov +
  regime classification) and `temporal-compare` (DTW pattern matching) as a
  **parallel tap** alongside RuView's existing event pipeline — no replacement,
  no behaviour change to the existing `/ws/sensing` fan-out or `wifi-densepose-signal`
  DSP. Two new endpoints (off by default, enabled via `--introspection`):
  - `GET /ws/introspection` — newline-delimited JSON snapshots streamed at the CSI
    frame rate. Each snapshot carries `frame_count`, `regime` (Idle / Periodic /
    Transient / Chaotic / Unknown), `lyapunov_exponent`, `attractor_dim`,
    `attractor_confidence`, `regime_changed` (boolean — flips on the first frame
    after a regime transition), and `top_k_similarity[]` (highest-scoring
    signature matches against a per-deployment library).
  - `GET /api/v1/introspection/snapshot` — single-shot JSON snapshot, auth-gated
    when `RUVIEW_API_TOKEN` is set.
  Per-frame `update()` budget measured at **0.041 ms p99** on the I5 bench
  (~24× under ADR-099 D4's 1 ms target). Shape-match latency on a 1-D
  mean-amplitude L1 stand-in: **5 frames** (3.20× ratio vs the 16-frame event-path
  floor). ADR-099 D8 honestly amended — the aspirational 10× bar is contingent on
  ADR-208 Phase 2 multi-dim NPU embeddings; this release ships the tap off-by-default
  while the foundation lands. 8 lib tests + 5 latency/regression tests (`tests/introspection_latency.rs`,
  including a 200-frame noise warm-up → 10-frame motion-ramp signature benchmark).
- **Opt-in bearer-token auth on `wifi-densepose-sensing-server`'s `/api/v1/*` HTTP surface (closes #443).**
  New `wifi_densepose_sensing_server::bearer_auth` module: when the
  `RUVIEW_API_TOKEN` env var is set, every request whose path begins with
  `/api/v1/` must carry an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header (constant-time
  compared) or the server responds `401 Unauthorized`. When the variable is
  unset or empty the middleware is a no-op — the long-standing LAN-only
  deployment posture is preserved, so this is a binary deployment-time switch
  with **no default behaviour change**. `/health*`, `/ws/sensing`, and the
  `/ui/*` static mount are intentionally never gated (orchestrator probes +
  local browsers). Startup logs which mode is active and warns when auth is on
  with a `0.0.0.0` bind. 8 unit tests on the middleware (lib test count 191 → 199).
  Resolves the security audit raised in #443.

### Changed
- **Docker image: build-time guard for the UI assets, plus a CI workflow that
  rebuilds and pushes on every change (closes #520, #514).** `docker/Dockerfile.rust`
  now `RUN`s a guard after `COPY ui/` that fails the build if any of
  `index.html` / `observatory.html` / `pose-fusion.html` / `viz.html` / the
  `observatory/` / `pose-fusion/` / `components/` / `services/` directories are
  missing, so a stale image can never be silently produced again. New
  `.github/workflows/sensing-server-docker.yml` builds the image on push to
  `main` (paths-filtered) and on `v*` tags and pushes to both
  `docker.io/ruvnet/wifi-densepose` and `ghcr.io/ruvnet/wifi-densepose` with
  `latest` + `vX.Y.Z` + `sha-<short>` tags, then smoke-tests the published
  artifact: `/health`, `/api/v1/info`, the observatory + pose-fusion UI assets,
  and the `RUVIEW_API_TOKEN` auth path (no token → 401, wrong → 401, correct
  → 200). Uses `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` repo secrets for the
  Docker Hub push; ghcr.io uses the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- **rvCSI moved to its own repo and is now vendored as a submodule.** The 9 `rvcsi-*`
  crates (`rvcsi-core`/`-dsp`/`-events`/`-adapter-file`/`-adapter-nexmon`/`-ruvector`/
  `-runtime`/`-node`/`-cli` — added inline in #542) now live in
  [`github.com/ruvnet/rvcsi`](https://github.com/ruvnet/rvcsi): published to crates.io
  as `rvcsi-* 0.3.x`, to npm as `@ruv/rvcsi`, with a Claude Code plugin marketplace and
  a RuView-style README. RuView vendors it under `vendor/rvcsi` (alongside
  `vendor/ruvector` / `vendor/midstream` / `vendor/sublinear-time-solver`) and no longer
  carries inline copies in `v2/crates/`; consumers depend on the published crates (or the
  submodule's `crates/rvcsi-*` paths). `v2/Cargo.toml`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the README docs
  table updated accordingly. The ADRs (ADR-095, ADR-096), PRD, and DDD model stay in
  `docs/` here as the design record of the incubation.

### Fixed
- **README: corrected the camera-supervised pose-accuracy claim.** The README stated
  "92.9% PCK@20" for camera-supervised training; that figure does not appear in
  ADR-079 and is ~2.6× the ADR's own success target (>35% PCK@20). ADR-079 phases
  P7 (data collection), P8 (training + evaluation on real paired data) and P9
  (cross-room LoRA) are still `Pending`, so no measured camera-supervised PCK@20 has
  been published. README now states the proxy-supervised baseline (≈2.5%) and the
  ADR-079 target (35%+), and notes the eval phases are pending. Surfaced by the
  PowerPlatePulse training-pipeline audit (2026-05-11); 6 remaining audit findings
  tracked in the PR.
- **rvCSI `BaselineDriftDetector`: drift thresholds are now scale-relative, not absolute.**
  The detector compared `mean_amplitude` against its EWMA baseline with absolute
  thresholds (`anomaly_threshold = 1.0`, `drift_threshold = 0.15`) — fine for the
  synthetic unit tests (amplitudes ≈ 1.0), but raw ESP32 CSI is `int8` I/Q with
  amplitudes up to ~128, so the window-to-window RMS distance is routinely 5–50 ≫ 1.0
  and `AnomalyDetected` fired on ~96 % of windows (319/331 on a real node-1 capture).
  Drift is now `‖current − baseline‖₂ / ‖baseline‖₂` (a fraction, with an `eps` floor
  for a degenerate near-zero baseline), so one tuning works across raw-`int8` ESP32,
  `int16`-scaled Nexmon, and baseline-subtracted streams alike — `AnomalyDetected`
  drops to 40/331 on the same data, the existing detector tests still pass, and a
  `baseline_drift_is_scale_invariant_no_anomaly_storm` regression test was added.
  ADR-095 D13 / ADR-096 §2.1, §5 updated. Surfaced by an end-to-end test against
  real ESP32 CSI (a 7,000-frame node-1 capture; transcoder at
  `scripts/esp32_jsonl_to_rvcsi.py`).

### Added
- **rvCSI — edge RF sensing runtime (design + first implementation).** New subsystem **rvCSI**: a Rust-first / TypeScript-accessible / hardware-abstracted edge RF sensing runtime that normalizes WiFi CSI from Nexmon, ESP32, Intel, Atheros, file and replay sources into one validated `CsiFrame` schema, runs reusable DSP, emits typed confidence-scored events, and bridges to RuVector RF memory, an MCP tool server and a TS SDK.
  - **Design docs:** `docs/prd/rvcsi-platform-prd.md` (purpose, users, success criteria, FR1–FR10, NFRs, system architecture, data model); `docs/adr/ADR-095-rvcsi-edge-rf-sensing-platform.md` (the 15 architectural decisions: Rust core, C-at-the-boundary, TS SDK via napi-rs, normalized schema, validate-before-FFI, CSI-as-temporal-delta, RuVector as RF memory, replayability, detection≠decision, local-first, read-first/write-gated MCP, mandatory quality scoring, versioned calibration, plugin adapters); `docs/adr/ADR-096-rvcsi-ffi-crate-layout.md` (crate topology, the napi-c shim record format & contract, the napi-rs Node surface, build/test invariants); `docs/ddd/rvcsi-domain-model.md` (7 bounded contexts: Capture, Validation, Signal, Calibration, Event, Memory, Agent — with aggregates, invariants, context map and domain services). Indexed in `docs/adr/README.md` and `docs/ddd/README.md`.
  - **Crates** (9 new `v2/crates/rvcsi-*` workspace members): `rvcsi-core` (normalized `CsiFrame`/`CsiWindow`/`CsiEvent` schema, `AdapterProfile`, `CsiSource` plugin trait, id newtypes + `IdGenerator`, `RvcsiError`, the `validate_frame` pipeline + quality scoring; `forbid(unsafe_code)`); `rvcsi-adapter-nexmon` — the **napi-c** seam: `native/rvcsi_nexmon_shim.{c,h}` (the only C in the runtime — allocation-free, bounds-checked, ABI `1.1`), compiled via `build.rs`+`cc`, handling **two byte formats** — the compact self-describing "rvCSI Nexmon record", and the **real nexmon_csi UDP payload** (the 18-byte `magic 0x1111 · rssi · fctl · src_mac · seq · core/stream · chanspec · chip_ver` header + `nsub` int16 I/Q samples, the modern BCM43455c0/4358/4366c0 export read by CSIKit/`csireader.py`), with a Broadcom d11ac **chanspec decoder** (channel/bandwidth/band) — plus a pure-Rust **libpcap reader** (classic `.pcap`, all byte-order/timestamp-resolution magics, Ethernet/raw-IPv4/Linux-SLL link types) and a **Nexmon-chip / Raspberry-Pi-model registry** (`NexmonChip` / `RaspberryPiModel` — including the **Raspberry Pi 5** (CYW43455/BCM43455c0, same wireless as the Pi 4 — 20/40/80 MHz, 2.4+5 GHz, 64/128/256 subcarriers), the Pi 3B+/4/400, and the Pi Zero 2 W (BCM43436b0); `nexmon_adapter_profile` / `raspberry_pi_profile` build the per-chip `AdapterProfile`; `chip_ver` words auto-resolve to a chip). Wrapped by a documented `ffi` module and two `CsiSource`s: `NexmonAdapter` (record buffers) and `NexmonPcapAdapter` (real nexmon_csi UDP inside a `tcpdump -i wlan0 dst port 5500 -w csi.pcap` capture — the pcap timestamp stamps each frame; the chip is auto-detected from `chip_ver`, overridable via `.with_pi_model(Pi5)` / `.with_chip(...)`). `rvcsi-dsp` (DC removal, phase unwrap, smoothing, Hampel/MAD filter, sliding variance, baseline subtraction, motion-energy/presence/confidence features, heuristic breathing-band estimate, non-destructive `SignalPipeline`); `rvcsi-events` (`WindowBuffer`, the `EventDetector` trait + presence/motion/quality/baseline-drift state machines, `EventPipeline`; the baseline-drift detector uses **scale-relative** thresholds — drift as a fraction of the baseline's RMS magnitude — so one tuning works across raw-`int8` ESP32, `int16`-scaled Nexmon, and baseline-subtracted streams alike); `rvcsi-adapter-file` (the `.rvcsi` JSONL capture format, `FileRecorder`, `FileReplayAdapter` deterministic replay); `rvcsi-ruvector` (deterministic window/event embeddings, `cosine_similarity`, the `RfMemoryStore` trait, `InMemoryRfMemory` + `JsonlRfMemory` — a standin until the production RuVector binding); `rvcsi-runtime` (the no-FFI composition layer: `CaptureRuntime` = `CsiSource` + `validate_frame` + `SignalPipeline` + `EventPipeline`, plus one-shot helpers `summarize_capture`/`decode_nexmon_records`/`decode_nexmon_pcap`/`summarize_nexmon_pcap`/`events_from_capture`/`export_capture_to_rf_memory`); `rvcsi-node` — the **napi-rs** seam (a `["cdylib","rlib"]` Node addon, `build.rs` runs `napi_build::setup()`; thin `#[napi]` wrappers over `rvcsi-runtime` — `nexmonDecodeRecords`/`nexmonDecodePcap` (with optional `chip`)/`inspectNexmonPcap`/`decodeChanspec`/`nexmonChipName`/`nexmonProfile`/`nexmonChips`/`inspectCaptureFile`/`eventsFromCaptureFile`/`exportCaptureToRfMemory` + an `RvcsiRuntime` streaming class; everything that crosses to JS is a validated/normalized struct serialized to JSON); `rvcsi-cli` (the `rvcsi` binary: `record` (Nexmon-dump *or* `--source nexmon-pcap [--chip pi5]` → `.rvcsi`), `inspect`, `inspect-nexmon`, `nexmon-chips`, `decode-chanspec`, `replay`, `stream`, `events`, `health`, `calibrate` v0-baseline, `export ruvector`). Plus the `@ruv/rvcsi` npm package (`package.json`/`index.js`/`index.d.ts`/`README`/`__test__`) alongside `rvcsi-node` — a curated JS surface that parses the addon's JSON into plain `CsiFrame`/`CsiWindow`/`CsiEvent`/`SourceHealth`/`CaptureSummary`/`NexmonPcapSummary`/`DecodedChanspec` objects, with a lazy native-addon load.
  - **Tests:** 169 across the rvcsi crates (core 29, dsp 28, events 19 — incl. a baseline-drift scale-invariance regression, adapter-file 20 + 1 doctest, adapter-nexmon 28 — round-tripping through the C shim and synthetic libpcap files, incl. Pi 5 / chip-detection, ruvector 20 + 1 doctest, runtime 13, cli 10), 0 failures; all rvcsi crates build together and are clippy-clean (`rvcsi-node` under `deny(clippy::all)`); `forbid(unsafe_code)` everywhere except `rvcsi-adapter-nexmon` (FFI, every `unsafe` block documented). Also exercised end-to-end against a real 7,000-frame ESP32 node-1 capture (transcoded with `scripts/esp32_jsonl_to_rvcsi.py` — the stand-in for the not-yet-shipped `record --source esp32-jsonl`): `rvcsi inspect`/`replay`/`calibrate`/`events` all run on real hardware data. Not yet wired in: live radio capture, `rvcsi-adapter-esp32` (live serial/UDP ESP32 source), the WebSocket daemon (`rvcsi-daemon`), the MCP tool server (`rvcsi-mcp`), and the legacy nexmon *packed-float* CSI export — follow-ups on top of these crates.
- **`wifi-densepose-train`: `signal_features` module — wires `wifi-densepose-signal` into the training pipeline.** `wifi-densepose-signal` was previously a phantom dependency of `wifi-densepose-train` (listed in `Cargo.toml`, never imported). New `wifi_densepose_train::signal_features::extract_signal_features` (and `CsiSample::signal_features()`) run a windowed CSI observation's centre frame through `wifi_densepose_signal::features::FeatureExtractor`, producing a fixed-length (`FEATURE_LEN = 12`) amplitude/phase/PSD feature vector — the hook for a future vitals / multi-task supervision head (breathing- and heart-rate-band power are read off the PSD summary). The vector is produced on demand and not yet fed back into the loss. Surfaced by the 2026-05-11 training-pipeline audit (findings #1 "vitals features absent from training" and #2 "`wifi-densepose-signal` ghost dep").
- **`wifi-densepose-train`: `TrainingConfig` subcarrier-layout presets + a real-loader integration test.** New `TrainingConfig::for_subcarriers(native, target)` plus named presets `ht40_192()` (≈192-sc ESP32 HT40 → 56) and `multiband_168()` (168-sc ADR-078 multi-band mesh → 56), so non-MM-Fi CSI shapes are first-class instead of requiring manual `native_subcarriers`/`num_subcarriers` overrides; field docs now list the supported source counts and the multi-NIC mapping. New `tests/test_real_loader.rs` round-trips synthetic CSI through `.npy` files → `MmFiDataset::discover`/`get` (including the subcarrier-interpolation branch and the empty-root case) — exercising the on-disk loader path the deterministic `verify-training` proof intentionally bypasses. Addresses training-pipeline audit findings #6 (56-sc/1-NIC config default) and #7 (multi-band mesh not in config); the #4 concern ("proof uses synthetic data") is reframed — the proof *should* use a reproducible source, and this test covers the real loader it skips.

### Fixed
- **HuggingFace `MODEL_CARD.md`: marked the PIR/BME280 environmental-sensor ground-truth path as planned, not implemented** (training-pipeline audit finding #3) — the card presented PIR/BME280 weak-label fine-tuning as a current capability; there is no env-sensor ingestion in the training pipeline today.
- **README: corrected the camera-supervised pose-accuracy claim** (audit finding #5; see PR #535) — "92.9% PCK@20" → the ADR-079 target (35%+; proxy baseline 35.3%), noting P7/P8/P9 are pending.

### Added
- **`RollingP95` adaptive feature normalizer** (`v2/crates/wifi-densepose-sensing-server`) —
  Streaming P95 estimator (600-sample / ~30 s sliding window) that self-calibrates
  feature normalization to whatever distribution the deployment produces. Replaces
  fixed-scale denominators (`variance/300`, `motion/250`, `spectral/500`) which saturated
  when live ESP32 values exceeded those limits, collapsing dynamic range to zero.
  Cold-start (<60 samples) falls back to the legacy denominators so day-0 behaviour
  is preserved. Deployment-neutral: no hardcoded values. (ADR-044 §5.2)

- **`dedup_factor` runtime configuration API** (`v2/crates/wifi-densepose-sensing-server`) —
  Exposes the multi-node person-count deduplication divisor at runtime via REST:
  - `GET  /api/v1/config/dedup-factor` — read current value.
  - `POST /api/v1/config/dedup-factor` — set value (clamped 1.0–10.0, persisted).
  - `POST /api/v1/config/ground-truth` — auto-tunes `dedup_factor` from a known
    person count (`{"count": N}`); derives optimal divisor from current node-sum.
  Config is persisted to `data/config.json` and reloaded on restart. (ADR-044 §5.3)

- **`nvsim` crate — deterministic NV-diamond magnetometer pipeline simulator** (ADR-089) —
  New standalone leaf crate at `v2/crates/nvsim` modeling a forward-only
  magnetic sensing path: scene → source synthesis (Biot–Savart, dipole,
  current loop, ferrous induced moment) → material attenuation
  (Air/Drywall/Brick/Concrete/Reinforced/SteelSheet) → NV ensemble
  (4 〈111〉 axes, ODMR linear-readout proxy, shot-noise floor per
  Wolf 2015 / Barry 2020) → 16-bit ADC + lock-in demodulation →
  fixed-layout `MagFrame` records → SHA-256 witness. Six-pass build
  per `docs/research/quantum-sensing/15-nvsim-implementation-plan.md`.
  50 tests, ~4.5 M samples/s on x86_64 (4500× the Cortex-A53 1 kHz
  acceptance gate), pinned reference witness
  `cc8de9b01b0ff5bd97a6c17848a3f156c174ea7589d0888164a441584ec593b4`
  for byte-equivalence regression. WASM-ready by construction
  (zero `std::time/fs/env/process/thread`); builds cleanly for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. ADR-090 (Proposed, conditional) tracks the
  optional Lindblad/Hamiltonian extension if AC magnetometry, MW power
  saturation, hyperfine spectroscopy, or pulsed protocols become required.

### Fixed
- **WebSocket broadcast handler now handles Lagged events gracefully and sends periodic ping keepalives to prevent dashboard disconnects** —
  `handle_ws_client` and `handle_ws_pose_client` in `wifi-densepose-sensing-server`
  were treating `RecvError::Lagged` as a fatal error, causing instant disconnect
  when clients fell behind the 256-frame broadcast buffer at 10 Hz ingest.
  Clients would reconnect, immediately lag again, and rapid-cycle every 2–4 s.
  `Lagged` now continues (drops missed frames, logs debug) rather than breaking.
  Added 30 s ping keepalive on the sensing handler to prevent proxy idle timeouts.
- **Ghost skeletons in live UI with multi-node ESP32 setups** (#420, ADR-082) —
  `tracker_bridge::tracker_to_person_detections` documented itself as filtering
  to `is_alive()` tracks but in fact passed every non-Terminated track to the
  WebSocket stream. `Lost` tracks — kept inside `reid_window` for
  re-identification but not currently observed — were rendering as phantom
  skeletons, accumulating to 22-24 with 3 nodes × 10 Hz CSI while
  `estimated_persons` correctly reported 1. Added
  `PoseTracker::confirmed_tracks()` (Tentative + Active only) and rewired the
  bridge to use it. Lost tracks remain in the tracker for re-ID; they just
  no longer ship to the UI. Regression test:
  `test_lost_tracks_excluded_from_bridge_output`.
- **Rust workspace build with `--no-default-features` on Windows** (#366, #415) —
  `wifi-densepose-mat`, `wifi-densepose-sensing-server`, and `wifi-densepose-train`
  all depended on `wifi-densepose-signal` with default features enabled, which
  pulled `ndarray-linalg` → `openblas-src` → vcpkg/system-BLAS through the entire
  workspace. `--no-default-features` at the workspace root then could not opt out
  of BLAS, breaking `cargo build` / `cargo test` on Windows without vcpkg. All
  three consumers now declare `wifi-densepose-signal = { ..., default-features = false }`,
  so `cargo test --workspace --no-default-features` builds cleanly without
  vcpkg/openblas. Validated: 1,538 tests pass, 0 fail, 8 ignored.
- **`signal` test `test_estimate_occupancy_noise_only` failed without `eigenvalue`** —
  The test unwrapped the `NotCalibrated` stub returned when the BLAS-backed
  `estimate_occupancy` is compiled out. Gated with `#[cfg(feature = "eigenvalue")]`
  so it only runs when the real implementation is available.

## [v0.6.2-esp32] — 2026-04-20

Firmware release cutting ADR-081 and the Timer Svc stack fix discovered during
on-hardware validation. Cut from `main` at commit pointing to this entry.
Tested on ESP32-S3 (QFN56 rev v0.2, MAC `3c:0f:02:e9:b5:f8`), 30 s continuous
run: no crashes, 149 `rv_feature_state_t` emissions (~5 Hz), medium/slow ticks
firing cleanly, HEALTH mesh packets sent.

### Fixed
- **Firmware: Timer Svc stack overflow on ADR-081 fast loop** — `emit_feature_state()` runs inside the FreeRTOS Timer Svc task via the fast-loop callback; it calls `stream_sender` network I/O which pushes past the ESP-IDF 2 KiB default timer stack and panics ~1 s after boot. Bumped `CONFIG_FREERTOS_TIMER_TASK_STACK_DEPTH` to 8 KiB in `sdkconfig.defaults`, `sdkconfig.defaults.template`, and `sdkconfig.defaults.4mb`. Follow-up (tracked separately): move heavy work out of the timer daemon into a dedicated worker task.
- **Firmware: `adaptive_controller.c` implicit declaration** (#404) — `fast_loop_cb` called `emit_feature_state()` before its static definition, triggering `-Werror=implicit-function-declaration`. Added a forward declaration above the first use.

### Changed
- **CI: firmware build matrix (8MB + 4MB)** — `firmware-ci.yml` now matrix-builds both the default 8MB (`sdkconfig.defaults`) and 4MB SuperMini (`sdkconfig.defaults.4mb`) variants, uploading distinct artifacts and producing variant-named release binaries (`esp32-csi-node.bin` / `esp32-csi-node-4mb.bin`, `partition-table.bin` / `partition-table-4mb.bin`).

### Added
- **ADR-081: Adaptive CSI Mesh Firmware Kernel** — New 5-layer architecture
  (Radio Abstraction Layer / Adaptive Controller / Mesh Sensing Plane /
  On-device Feature Extraction / Rust handoff) that reframes the existing
  ESP32 firmware modules as components of a chipset-agnostic kernel. ADR
  in `docs/adr/ADR-081-adaptive-csi-mesh-firmware-kernel.md`. Goal: swap
  one radio family for another without changing the Rust signal /
  ruvector / train / mat crates.
- **Firmware: radio abstraction vtable (`rv_radio_ops_t`)** — New
  `firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/rv_radio_ops.{h}` defines the
  chipset-agnostic ops (init, set_channel, set_mode, set_csi_enabled,
  set_capture_profile, get_health), profile enum
  (`RV_PROFILE_PASSIVE_LOW_RATE` / `ACTIVE_PROBE` / `RESP_HIGH_SENS` /
  `FAST_MOTION` / `CALIBRATION`), and health snapshot struct.
  `rv_radio_ops_esp32.c` provides the ESP32 binding wrapping
  `csi_collector` + `esp_wifi_*`. A second binding (mock or alternate
  chipset) is the portability acceptance test for ADR-081.
- **Firmware: `rv_feature_state_t` packet (magic `0xC5110006`)** — New
  60-byte compact per-node sensing state (packed, verified by
  `_Static_assert`) in `firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/rv_feature_state.h`:
  motion, presence, respiration BPM/conf, heartbeat BPM/conf, anomaly
  score, env-shift score, node coherence, quality flags, IEEE CRC32.
  Replaces raw ADR-018 CSI as the default upstream stream (~99.7%
  bandwidth reduction: 300 B/s at 5 Hz vs. ~100 KB/s raw).
- **Firmware: mock radio ops binding for QEMU** — New
  `firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/rv_radio_ops_mock.c`, compiled only when
  `CONFIG_CSI_MOCK_ENABLED`. Satisfies ADR-081's portability acceptance
  test: a second `rv_radio_ops_t` binding compiles and runs against the
  same controller + mesh-plane code as the ESP32 binding.
- **Firmware: feature-state emitter wired into controller fast loop** —
  `adaptive_controller.c` now emits one 60-byte `rv_feature_state_t` per
  fast tick (default 200 ms → 5 Hz), pulling from the latest edge vitals
  and controller observation. This is the first end-to-end Layer 4/5
  path for ADR-081.
- **Firmware: `csi_collector_get_pkt_yield_per_sec()` /
  `_get_send_fail_count()` accessors** — Expose the CSI callback rate
  and UDP send-failure counter so the ESP32 radio ops binding can
  populate `rv_radio_health_t.pkt_yield_per_sec` and `.send_fail_count`,
  closing the adaptive controller's observation loop.
- **Firmware: host-side unit test suite for ADR-081 pure logic** — New
  `firmware/esp32-csi-node/tests/host/` (Makefile + 2 test files + shim
  `esp_err.h`). Exercises `adaptive_controller_decide()` (9 test cases:
  degraded gate on pkt-yield collapse + coherence loss, anomaly > motion,
  motion → SENSE_ACTIVE, aggressive cadence, stable presence →
  RESP_HIGH_SENS, empty-room default, hysteresis, NULL safety) and
  `rv_feature_state_*` helpers (size assertion, IEEE CRC32 known
  vectors, determinism, receiver-side verification). 33/33 assertions
  pass. Benchmarks: decide() 3.2 ns/call, CRC32(56 B) 614 ns/pkt
  (87 MB/s), full finalize() 616 ns/call. Pure function
  `adaptive_controller_decide()` extracted to
  `adaptive_controller_decide.c` so the firmware build and the host
  tests share a single source-of-truth implementation.
- **Scripts: `validate_qemu_output.py` ADR-081 checks** — Validator
  (invoked by ADR-061 `scripts/qemu-esp32s3-test.sh` in CI) gains three
  checks for adaptive controller boot line, mock radio ops
  registration, and slow-loop heartbeat, so QEMU runs regression-gate
  Layer 1/2 presence.
- **Firmware: ADR-081 Layer 3 mesh sensing plane** — New
  `firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/rv_mesh.{h,c}` defines 4 node roles
  (Anchor / Observer / Fusion relay / Coordinator), 7 on-wire message
  types (TIME_SYNC, ROLE_ASSIGN, CHANNEL_PLAN, CALIBRATION_START,
  FEATURE_DELTA, HEALTH, ANOMALY_ALERT), 3 authorization classes
  (None / HMAC-SHA256-session / Ed25519-batch), `rv_node_status_t`
  (28 B), `rv_anomaly_alert_t` (28 B), `rv_time_sync_t`,
  `rv_role_assign_t`, `rv_channel_plan_t`, `rv_calibration_start_t`.
  Pure-C encoder/decoder (`rv_mesh_encode()` / `rv_mesh_decode()`) with
  16-byte envelope + payload + IEEE CRC32 trailer; convenience encoders
  for each message type. Controller now emits `HEALTH` every slow-loop
  tick (30 s default) and `ANOMALY_ALERT` on state transitions to ALERT
  or DEGRADED. Host tests: `test_rv_mesh` exercises 27 assertions
  covering roundtrip, bad magic, truncation, CRC flipping, oversize
  payload rejection, and encode+decode throughput (1.0 μs/roundtrip
  on host).
- **Rust: ADR-081 Layer 1/3 mirror module** — New
  `crates/wifi-densepose-hardware/src/radio_ops.rs` mirrors the
  firmware-side `rv_radio_ops_t` vtable as the Rust `RadioOps` trait
  (init, set_channel, set_mode, set_csi_enabled, set_capture_profile,
  get_health) and provides `MockRadio` for offline testing.
  Also mirrors the `rv_mesh.h` types (`MeshHeader`, `NodeStatus`,
  `AnomalyAlert`, `MeshRole`, `MeshMsgType`, `AuthClass`) and ships
  byte-identical `crc32_ieee()`, `decode_mesh()`, `decode_node_status()`,
  `decode_anomaly_alert()`, and `encode_health()`. Exported from
  `lib.rs`. 8 unit tests pass; `crc32_matches_firmware_vectors`
  verifies parity with the firmware-side test vectors
  (`0xCBF43926` for `"123456789"`, `0xD202EF8D` for single-byte zero),
  and `mesh_constants_match_firmware` asserts `MESH_MAGIC`,
  `MESH_VERSION`, `MESH_HEADER_SIZE`, and `MESH_MAX_PAYLOAD` match
  `rv_mesh.h` byte-for-byte. Satisfies ADR-081's portability
  acceptance test: signal/ruvector/train/mat crates are untouched.
- **Firmware: adaptive controller** — New
  `firmware/esp32-csi-node/main/adaptive_controller.{c,h}` implements
  the three-loop closed-loop control specified by ADR-081: fast
  (~200 ms) for cadence and active probing, medium (~1 s) for channel
  selection and role transitions, slow (~30 s) for baseline
  recalibration. Pure `adaptive_controller_decide()` policy function is
  exposed in the header for offline unit testing. Default policy is
  conservative (`enable_channel_switch` and `enable_role_change` off);
  Kconfig surface added under "Adaptive Controller (ADR-081)".

### Fixed
- **Firmware: SPI flash cache crash under high CSI callback pressure** (RuView#396, #397) — ESP32-S3 nodes crashed in `cache_ll_l1_resume_icache` / `wDev_ProcessFiq` after ~2400 callbacks when the promiscuous filter admitted DATA frames at 100–500 Hz. Fixed by narrowing the filter mask to `WIFI_PROMIS_FILTER_MASK_MGMT` (~10 Hz beacons), adding a 50 Hz early callback rate gate (`CSI_MIN_PROCESS_INTERVAL_US`) that drops excess callbacks before any processing work, and enabling `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_EXTRA_IRAM_OPT=y` as defense-in-depth. Stability validated with a 4-min-per-node soak.
- **Firmware: `filter_mac` / `node_id` clobber by WiFi driver init** (#232, #375, #385, #386, #390, #397) — `g_nvs_config` can be corrupted during `wifi_init_sta()` on some devices (confirmed on `80:b5:4e:c1:be:b8`), reverting `node_id` to the Kconfig default and producing garbage MAC-filter reads in the CSI callback (100–500 Hz). New `csi_collector_set_node_id()` API called from `app_main()` **before** `wifi_init_sta()` captures both fields into module-local statics (`s_node_id`, `s_filter_mac`, `s_filter_mac_set`). `csi_collector_init()` now runs a canary that distinguishes "early≠g_nvs_config" (corruption confirmed) from a no-op match. All CSI runtime paths use the defensive copies exclusively.
- **Firmware: `edge_processing` sample rate mismatch** (#397) — `estimate_bpm_zero_crossing()` was called with a hard-coded `sample_rate = 20.0f`, but MGMT-only promiscuous delivers ~10 Hz. Breathing and heart-rate reports were 2× too high. Corrected to `10.0f` with an explicit comment tying it to the callback rate.
- **`provision.py` esptool command form** (#391, #397) — ESP-IDF v5.4 bundles `esptool 4.10.0`, which only accepts `write_flash` (underscore). Standalone `pip install esptool` v5.x accepts both forms but prefers `write-flash`. #391 switched to `write-flash` which broke the documented ESP-IDF Python venv flow; #397 reverts to `write_flash` (works with both esptool 4.x and 5.x) with an inline comment warning future maintainers not to "re-fix" it.
- **`provision.py` esptool v5 dry-run hint** (#391) — Stale `write_flash` (underscore) syntax in the dry-run manual-flash hint now uses `write-flash` (hyphenated) for esptool >= 5.x. The primary flash command was already correct.
- **`provision.py` silent NVS wipe** (#391) — The script replaces the entire `csi_cfg` NVS namespace on every run, so partial invocations were silently erasing WiFi credentials and causing `Retrying WiFi connection (10/10)` in the field. Now refuses to run without `--ssid`, `--password`, and `--target-ip` unless `--force-partial` is passed. `--force-partial` prints a warning listing which keys will be wiped.
- **Firmware: defensive `node_id` capture** (#232, #375, #385, #386, #390) — Users on multi-node deployments reported `node_id` reverting to the Kconfig default (`1`) in UDP frames and in the `csi_collector` init log, despite NVS loading the correct value. The root cause (memory corruption of `g_nvs_config`) has not been definitively isolated, but the UDP frame header is now tamper-proof: `csi_collector_init()` captures `g_nvs_config.node_id` into a module-local `s_node_id` once, and `csi_serialize_frame()` plus all other consumers (`edge_processing.c`, `wasm_runtime.c`, `display_ui.c`, `swarm_bridge_init`) read it via the new `csi_collector_get_node_id()` accessor. A canary logs `WARN` if `g_nvs_config.node_id` diverges from `s_node_id` at end-of-init, helping isolate the upstream corruption path. Validated on attached ESP32-S3 (COM8): NVS `node_id=2` propagates through boot log, capture log, init log, and byte[4] of every UDP frame.

### Performance
- Presence detection: 100% accuracy on 60,630 overnight samples. *(Retracted — that recording was single-class (one sleeping person, 6,062/6,063 frames "present"), so a constant "yes" scores ~99.98%. Superseded by the honest 82.3% held-out temporal-triplet metric; see [#882](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/882). Kept here as the in-place public record.)*
- Inference: 0.008 ms per sample, 164K embeddings/sec.
- Contrastive self-supervised training: 51.6% improvement over baseline.

## [v0.5.5-esp32] — 2026-04-03

- **MinCut person counting (ADR-075)** — Stoer-Wagner min-cut on subcarrier correlation graph. Fixes #348 (was always reporting 4 people).
- **CNN spectrogram embeddings (ADR-076)** — Treat 64×20 CSI as an image, produce 128-dim environment fingerprints (0.95+ same-room similarity).
- **Graph transformer fusion** — Multi-node CSI fusion via GATv2 attention (replaces naive averaging).
- **Camera-free pose training pipeline** — Trains 17-keypoint model from 10 sensor signals with no camera required.

## [v0.5.4-esp32] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **ADR-069: ESP32 CSI → Cognitum Seed RVF ingest pipeline** — Live-validated pipeline connecting ESP32-S3 CSI sensing to Cognitum Seed (Pi Zero 2 W) edge intelligence appliance. 339 vectors ingested, 100% kNN validation, SHA-256 witness chain verified.
- **Feature vector packet (magic 0xC5110003)** — New 48-byte packet with 8 normalized dimensions (presence, motion, breathing, heart rate, phase variance, person count, fall, RSSI) sent at 1 Hz alongside vitals.
- **`scripts/seed_csi_bridge.py`** — Python bridge: UDP listener → HTTPS ingest with bearer token auth, `--validate` (kNN + PIR ground truth), `--stats`, `--compact` modes, hash-based vector IDs, NaN/inf rejection, source IP filtering, retry logic.

- **Cognitum Seed MCP integration** — 114-tool MCP proxy enables AI assistants to query sensing state, vectors, witness chain, and device status directly.

### Fixed
- **Compressed frame magic collision** — Reassigned compressed frame magic from `0xC5110003` to `0xC5110005` to free `0xC5110003` for feature vectors.
- **Uninitialized `s_top_k[0]` read** — Guarded variance computation against `s_top_k_count == 0` in `send_feature_vector()`.
- **Presence score normalization** — Bridge now divides by 15.0 instead of clamping, preserving dynamic range for raw values 1.41-14.92.
- **Stale magic references** — Updated ADR-039, DDD model to reflect `0xC5110005` for compressed frames.

### Security
- **Credential exposure remediation** — Removed hardcoded WiFi passwords and bearer tokens from source files. Added NVS binary/CSV patterns to `.gitignore`. Environment variable fallback for bearer token.
- **NaN/Inf injection prevention** — Bridge validates all feature dimensions are finite before Seed ingest.
- **UDP source filtering** — `--allowed-sources` argument restricts packet acceptance to known ESP32 IPs.

### Changed

## [v0.5.3-esp32] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Cross-node RSSI-weighted feature fusion** — Multiple ESP32 nodes fuse CSI features using RSSI-based weighting. Closer node gets higher weight. Reduces variance noise by 29%, keypoint jitter by 72%.
- **DynamicMinCut person separation** — Uses `ruvector_mincut::DynamicMinCut` on the subcarrier temporal correlation graph to detect independent motion clusters. Replaces variance-based heuristic for multi-person counting.
- **RSSI-based position tracking** — Skeleton position driven by RSSI differential between nodes. Walk between ESP32s and the skeleton follows you.
- **Per-node state pipeline (ADR-068)** — Each ESP32 node gets independent `HashMap<u8, NodeState>` with frame history, classification, vitals, and person count. Fixes #249 (the #1 user-reported issue).
- **RuVector Phase 1-3 integration** — Subcarrier importance weighting, temporal keypoint smoothing (EMA), coherence gating, skeleton kinematic constraints (Jakobsen relaxation), compressed pose history.
- **Client-side lerp smoothing** — UI keypoints interpolate between frames (alpha=0.15) for fluid skeleton movement.
- **Multi-node mesh tests** — 8 integration tests covering 1-255 node configurations.
- **`wifi_densepose` Python package** — `from wifi_densepose import WiFiDensePose` now works (#314).

### Fixed
- **Watchdog crash on busy LANs (#321)** — Batch-limited edge_dsp to 4 frames before 20ms yield. Fixed idle-path busy-spin (`pdMS_TO_TICKS(5)==0`).
- **No detection from edge vitals (#323)** — Server now generates `sensing_update` from Tier 2+ vitals packets.
- **RSSI byte offset mismatch (#332)** — Server parsed RSSI from wrong byte (was reading sequence counter).
- **Stack overflow risk** — Moved 4KB of BPM scratch buffers from stack to static storage.
- **Stale node memory leak** — `node_states` HashMap evicts nodes inactive >60s.
- **Unsafe raw pointer removed** — Replaced with safe `.clone()` for adaptive model borrow.
- **Firmware CI** — Upgraded to IDF v5.4, replaced `xxd` with `od` (#327).
- **Person count double-counting** — Multi-node aggregation changed from `sum` to `max`.
- **Skeleton jitter** — Removed tick-based noise, dampened procedural animation, recalibrated feature scaling for real ESP32 data.

### Changed
- Motion-responsive skeleton: arm swing (0-80px) driven by CSI variance, leg kick (0-50px) by motion_band_power, vertical bob when walking.
- Person count thresholds recalibrated for real ESP32 hardware (1→2 at 0.70, EMA alpha 0.04).
- Vital sign filtering: larger median window (31), faster EMA (0.05), looser HR jump filter (15 BPM).
- Vendored ruvector updated to v2.1.0-40 (316 commits ahead).

### Benchmarks (2-node mesh, COM6 + COM9, 30s)
| Metric | Baseline | v0.5.3 | Improvement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Variance noise | 109.4 | 77.6 | **-29%** |

## [v0.5.0-esp32] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **60 GHz mmWave sensor fusion (ADR-063)** — Auto-detects Seeed MR60BHA2 (60 GHz, HR/BR/presence) and HLK-LD2410 (24 GHz, presence/distance) on UART at boot. Probes 115200 then 256000 baud, registers device capabilities, starts background parser.
- **48-byte fused vitals packet** (magic `0xC5110004`) — Kalman-style fusion: mmWave 80% + CSI 20% when both available. Automatic fallback to standard 32-byte CSI-only packet.
- **Server-side fusion bridge** (`scripts/mmwave_fusion_bridge.py`) — Reads two serial ports simultaneously for dual-sensor setups where mmWave runs on a separate ESP32.
- **Multimodal ambient intelligence roadmap (ADR-064)** — 25+ applications from fall detection to sleep monitoring to RF tomography.

### Verified
- Real hardware: ESP32-S3 (COM7) WiFi CSI + ESP32-C6/MR60BHA2 (COM4) 60 GHz mmWave running concurrently. HR=75 bpm, BR=25/min at 52 cm range. All 11 QEMU CI jobs green.

## [v0.4.3-esp32] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Fall detection false positives (#263)** — Default threshold raised from 2.0 to 15.0 rad/s²; normal walking (2-5 rad/s²) no longer triggers alerts. Added 3-consecutive-frame debounce and 5-second cooldown between alerts. Verified on real ESP32-S3 hardware: 0 false alerts in 60s / 1,300+ live WiFi CSI frames.
- **Kconfig default mismatch** — `CONFIG_EDGE_FALL_THRESH` Kconfig default was still 2000 (=2.0) while `nvs_config.c` fallback was updated to 15.0. Fixed Kconfig to 15000. Caught by real hardware testing — mock data did not reproduce.
- **provision.py NVS generator API change** — `esp_idf_nvs_partition_gen` package changed its `generate()` signature; switched to subprocess-first invocation for cross-version compatibility.
- **QEMU CI pipeline (11 jobs)** — Fixed all failures: fuzz test `esp_timer` stubs, QEMU `libgcrypt` dependency, NVS matrix generator, IDF container `pip` path, flash image padding, validation WARN handling, swarm `ip`/`cargo` missing.

### Added
- **4MB flash support (#265)** — `partitions_4mb.csv` and `sdkconfig.defaults.4mb` for ESP32-S3 boards with 4MB flash (e.g. SuperMini). Dual OTA slots, 1.856 MB each. Thanks to @sebbu for the community workaround that confirmed feasibility.
- **`--strict` flag** for `validate_qemu_output.py` — WARNs now pass by default in CI (no real WiFi in QEMU); use `--strict` to fail on warnings.

  - `CrossDomainEvaluator` — 6-metric evaluation protocol (MPJPE in-domain/cross-domain/few-shot/cross-hardware, domain gap ratio, adaptation speedup)
- ADR-027: Cross-Environment Domain Generalization — 10 SOTA citations (PerceptAlign, X-Fi ICLR 2025, AM-FM, DGSense, CVPR 2024)
- **Cross-platform RSSI adapters** — macOS CoreWLAN (`MacosCoreWlanScanner`) and Linux `iw` (`LinuxIwScanner`) Rust adapters with `#[cfg(target_os)]` gating
- macOS CoreWLAN Python sensing adapter with Swift helper (`mac_wifi.swift`)
- macOS synthetic BSSID generation (FNV-1a hash) for Sonoma 14.4+ BSSID redaction
- Linux `iw dev <iface> scan` parser with freq-to-channel conversion and `scan dump` (no-root) mode
- ADR-025: macOS CoreWLAN WiFi Sensing (ORCA)

### Fixed
- **sendto ENOMEM crash (Issue #127)** — CSI callbacks in promiscuous mode exhaust lwIP pbuf pool causing guru meditation crash. Fixed with 50 Hz rate limiter in `csi_collector.c` and 100 ms ENOMEM backoff in `stream_sender.c`. Hardware-verified on ESP32-S3 (200+ callbacks, zero crashes)
- **Provisioning script missing TDM/edge flags (Issue #130)** — Added `--tdm-slot`, `--tdm-total`, `--edge-tier`, `--pres-thresh`, `--fall-thresh`, `--vital-win`, `--vital-int`, `--subk-count` to `provision.py`
- **WebSocket "RECONNECTING" on Dashboard/Live Demo** — `sensingService.start()` now called on app init in `app.js` so WebSocket connects immediately instead of waiting for Sensing tab visit
- **Mobile WebSocket port** — `ws.service.ts` `buildWsUrl()` uses same-origin port instead of hardcoded port 3001
- **Mobile Jest config** — `testPathIgnorePatterns` no longer silently ignores the entire test directory
- Removed synthetic byte counters from Python `MacosWifiCollector` — now reports `tx_bytes=0, rx_bytes=0` instead of fake incrementing values

- CLI flags: `--pretrain`, `--pretrain-epochs`, `--embed`, `--build-index <type>`
- Four HNSW-compatible fingerprint index types: `env_fingerprint`, `activity_pattern`, `temporal_baseline`, `person_track`
- Cross-modal `PoseEncoder` for WiFi-to-camera embedding alignment
- VICReg regularization for embedding collapse prevention
- 53K total parameters (55 KB at INT8) — fits on ESP32

- **Docker port mismatch** — server now binds 3000/3001 inside container as documented (`44b9c30`)
- Added `/ws/sensing` WebSocket route to the HTTP server so UI only needs one port
- Fixed README API endpoint references: `/api/v1/health` → `/health`, `/api/v1/sensing` → `/api/v1/sensing/latest`
